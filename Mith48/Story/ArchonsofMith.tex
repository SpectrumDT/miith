\chapter{\TheLieSublimeBook}
\section{New civilizations appear}
After the \secondbanewar, \resphain{} and \dragons{} alike fought on with all the spite they could muster\dash against each other, and internally. For thousands of years. Both sides had lost great leaders in the war and were now divided, left in chaos. Their civilizations declined. 

Other civilizations arose around them. The \dragons{} and \banes{} alike sought to use these mortals as pawns in their game, reigning as their gods and sending them to die for the \secretwar.









\section{\Cuezca (\yds{Cuezca rises})}
\target{Cuezca}
The greatest of these new civilizations was \hr{Cuezca}{\Cuezca}. 
At the time when the \hr{Cuezcan}{\Cuezcan} people evolved, both sides in the \secretwar{} were especially weakened, weak enough for the nascent \Cuezcan{} civilization to develop in peace. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Draconis Albionensis}{
  It was a time of change. \\
  The descendants of the Atlantean mages had fallen before the New Praesidium, \\
  and the wolves were baying at the Empire's door.\\
  An oppressive new faith was encroaching from the east, \\
  and the sylvan liege had locked tight the gates of his arboreal realm. \\
  And so it was that towards the end of the Age of Mystery, \\
  the last of Albion's great Dragon Lords did gather \\
  for what would be their final battle...
}

Some \Cuezcans{} serve the \dragons. They adopt \Draconic{} speech, runes and sorcery. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Draconis Albionensis}{
  [The War-song of the Dragon Lords:]\\
  Dragon-phalanx rend the sky, Albion our gleaming prize,\\
  Sentinels of land and sea, guardians of destiny.\\
  Prowling amongst the pecseatan; \\
  Draconis Bipedes, swift and furious beast of battle!
  
  Dragonfyre in the fray, faith and steel shall win the day,\\
  A god to serf and king alike, the Adamantine Hammer strikes!\\
  Devouring the infidel outlanders; \\

  Dragon Imperium, behold the axiom. \\
  %Imperator Draconis, await your nemesis.
  All hail to Draconis Albionensis!
}









\subsection{Different Realm}
\Cuezca{} existed in some \hs{Shrouded Realm} different from \hr{Azmith}{\Azmith}. 
The fall of \Cuezca{} took place not long before the birth of \hs{Cordos Vaimon} and \hs{Silqua}. 
In fact, \hr{Cuezca motivated Vaimons}{it motivated the inception of the Vaimon order}. 









\section{The \CuezcanApocalypse (\yds{Cuezcan Apocalypse})}
\target{Cuezcan Apocalypse}
\Dragons{} and \banes{} alike recognize that \Cuezca{} is a power factor, so they both try to sway them to their cause. 
They woo the \cuezcans{} very directly, using all means. 
They also teach their magic and science to the \cuezcans{}. 

The \cuezcans{} become megalomanic.

\lyricsbalsagoth{Draconis Albionensis}{
  There is no ignominy, there is glory.\\
  There is no servitude, there is dominance.\\
  There is no defeat, there is victory.\\
  Victory eternal!\\
  
  It is time! \\
  We shall rule, and upon our dominion the sun shall never set!
}

\lyricsbalsagoth{Return to the Praesidium of Ys}{
  Your invocations unleashed the Great Worm\\
  which compelled the devouring seas to [\Cuezca].}

\index{technology!\cuezcan}
The \cuezcans{} master magic and technology. They wage war with nukes, bio-bombs and what is worse. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Atlantis Ascendant}{

}

They use terrible weapons of mass destruction. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Deus Ex Machina}{
  He threw between the three cities of the Vrishnis and the Andakas one single projectile, that was loaded with all the power of the universe. 
  A white glowing column of smoke and fire, as bright as ten thousand suns arose in all its splendour. 
  This was the unprecedented weapon, the iron lightning, a giant messenger of death, that burnt the entire family of Vrishnis and Andakas to ashes. 
  
  (Taken from the Mahabharata one fo the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India.)
}









\subsection{The First Advent of \Lithrim}
\target{First Advent of Lithrim}
\hr{Lithrim}{\Lithrim}, the \bane god of destruction, was spawned.
With the help of the mighty \Cuezcans and their mighty sorcery, it was summoned to \Miith.
Here it wrought havoc. 

After a terrible battle, the Sentinels defeated \Lithrim and destroyed it. 

The Sentinels believed \Lithrim was now defeated forever. 
But the \banes had more tricks up their sleeve.
\Lithrim had been blasted into many fragments. 
The \banes took the fragments of \Lithrim and put them inside \human bodies. 

But to obscure their true purpose, the \banes moved \Lithrim from the \Cuezcan Realm and into another Shrouded Realm: 
\Azmith.
The Sentinels did not suspect this, so they did not detect it. 

\target{Men of Light created}
These \humans who carried \Lithrim inside them became a particular \demihuman race:
The \hr{Men of Light}{Men of the Light}. 
Cordos Vaimon and Silqua were considered the founders of this race. 

Compare to how God incarnates in \humanity in the anime \cite{Anime:MaoDante}. 
And the way \humanity is really the angel Lilim in the anime \cite{Anime:NeonGenesisEvangelion}. 









\subsection{The world is devastated}
The result is a catastrophe: 
With their newly acquired power, the \cuezcans{} cause immense destruction, tearing great expanses of the Realms apart. 
\Cuezca{} is destroyed in the process. 

The world is violently torn apart and laid waste by the terrible destruction. 

\lyricsbible{Revelations 8:7}{
  And there followed hail and fire with blood, 
  and they were cast upon the earth.
  And the third part of trees was burnt up, 
  and all the green grass was burnt up.
  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.\\
  And the third part of the waters became wormwood.\\
  And many men died of the waters,
  because they were made bitter\\
}









\subsection{The Unspoken Covenant of the \Charade}
After the \CuezcanApocalypse, some leaders among both sides, \Ishnaruchaefir{} among them, realized that the war was going too far.

There was a fear that both sides were going down a road of \quo{Mutually Assured Destruction}, and there was a desire to contain the war.
The \dragons{} and \banes{} realize that open war\dash especially open war using mortal pawns, armed with power they can't wield responsibly\dash is no good, and that if they continue this way, they will destroy the world, leaving nothing to rule. 
Also, wise ones predicted that given the \hr{Balance of the Matrices}{balance of the \matrices}, the war was unlikely to see any resolution for thousands of years. 

And so, by silent mutual consent, the Unspoken Covenant was created.
It would separate the mortal world from the immortals' endless war. 

\target{Tiphred-Serah formulate Unspoken Covenant}
Some \resphain{} of \TiphredSerah{} were instrumental in formulating and popularizing the Covenant. 

The Cabal and the Sentinels of \Miith{} are formed and the Unspoken Covenant is adopted. The Covenant dictates that the Cabal and Sentinels strive to keep mortals ignorant of the true world that surrounds them. They must not know of the secret organizations' existence, the underground war, their own origins nor the nature of the Realms. Also, the progress of science (including magic) must be suppressed and kept in check, and the Cabal and Sentinels must not teach their arcane knowledge to outsiders. 

The \Feud ing factions agreed on the Unspoken Covenant, and the \charade{} began. 
Among the master races there was now a widespread agreement to phase out their visible dominance in favour of a more hidden dominance. 
In the Shrouded Realms, that is. 
Not the Immortal Realms. 

This was both easier and more necessary now, because there were so few immortals left. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Reptile}{
  And so I will take shelter\\
  in the absence of the light.\\
  Hiding like a masked miniature in the dark.\\
  A revenant without relief, it seems.\\
  For the art of becoming a progeny \\
  and to be raised in such curse\\
  is to forever creep among \naive{} mortals,\\
  Infesting the dead in herdes.
}









\subsection{Vaimons came soon after}
Not long after the \CuezcanApocalypse, the \hs{Cabal formed}. 
Not long after that, they \hr{Cuezca motivated Vaimons}{began to plan the Vaimon gambit}. 























\chapter{\SilquaBook}















\section{Premise}
This book has two parallel plots: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    The \hr{Cabal formed}{forming of the Cabal} and the \hr{Fall of Kezerad}{fall of \Kezerad} in the Immortal Realms. 
  \item 
    Cordos' empire-building-business and Silqua's religion-founding-business in \Azmith. 
\end{enumerate}









\subsection{The Forming of the Cabal}
\target{Cabal formed}
The Cabal was formed not long before this book. 
Perhaps during the \CuezcanApocalypse{} decades before, perhaps just few years before. 

I need to remember to have a prologue showing the Cabal being formed. 

Some the \banelords, after being locked out in the \hr{Shrouding}{\Shrouding}, had wormed their way back into the world and gained a stronger foothold. 
This gave them new power. 
Suddenly they had the political weight to once again coerce the \resphain{} to do their bidding. 
They decreed that the dynasties should ally and form a united block. 
Whether the dynasties liked it or not. 

\target{Tiphred-Serah form Cabal}
Some \resphain{} of \TiphredSerah{} were instrumental in forming the Cabal. 
It was they who came up with the ideas for the organization of the Cabal and approached the other dynasties and negotiated the terms of their alliance. 

\target{Consolidation}
\index{Consolidation}
The slow process of allying the various \resphan{} factions was called the Consolidation. 
It took several decades.





\subsubsection{\Cuezca motivated Vaimons}
\target{Cuezca motivated Vaimons}
The fiasco of the \CuezcanApocalypse{} was part of what motivated the formation of the Vaimon order. 
The Cabal agreed on the \hs{Unspoken Covenant}, which limited their direct involvement in the world. 
This meant they would need to have servants to interact with the world for them. 
Preferably powerful ones. 
Preferably mages. 
So they began plotting how to found a Cabal-sponsored order of mortal mages. 









\subsection{The Fall of \Kezerad}
\target{Kezeradi War}
\target{Fall of Kezerad}
\TiphredSerah, \CiriathSepher{} and \Mystraacht{} were eventually bullied into teaming up and form what became known as the Cabal. 
But most of the \Baelzerach{} tribes refused. 

More importantly, \Kezerad{} refused. 

\Daggerrain{} was not happy. 
He had his eyes on the \Kezeradi{} \dweomer. 
He recognized that it had great potential to serve his plans as a prison for \human{} souls, but he needed to gain control of it and corrupt it first. 
\Daggerrain{} decided that if the \Kezeradi{} would not heel, they must be destroyed. 
So he had the other dynasties invade \Kezerad. 

The other \resphain{} were all too eager to wage war against \Kezerad{} to \hr{Resphan vampirism}{sate their cannibalistic hunger}. 

Perhaps \Kezerad{} was already at war with the \Baelzerach{} or another foe, and their fellow \resphain{} backstabbed them.

Anyway, \Kezerad{} was invaded by \resphan{} and \bane{} armies and was destroyed. 
Compare this to the destruction of the Blue Dragonflight in the \emph{Warcraft: War of the Ancients} books by Richard Knaak. 

Their leaders were transformed into the terrible \Sephiroth{}, and their \iquin{} was corrupted and twisted into the loathsome \carcer{} it is today.

%They fought against their former masters and their fellow \resphain, and eventually they were destroyed. Their leaders were transformed into \Sephiroth. 









\subsection{\Imrath{} and the World Around It}
At this point, \Imrath{} is at war with a neighbouring \scathaese{} kingdom. Relations between \humans{} and \scathae{} are very bad throughout the continent. Some of the \scathaese{} kingdoms are ruled by \dragons{} (overtly or covertly), and most \humans{} learn to hate the \dragons{} as evil monsters, and the \scathae{} (called \squo{Creeps}) as their evil monster-spawn. Among \humans{}, all magic is scorned as evil \squo{{\dragoncraft}}. The overall technology is Bronze Age (about 500 BC in RL terms). 

Some nations (especially \scathaese{}) worship \draconic{} gods, or the \dragons{} themselves. Others worship other monstrous gods. In \Imrath{} (and several other \human{} kingdoms), all these \squo{demon gods} are scorned, and the official religion is a vague belief in \squo{the Light}, representing good and justice. This religion is based on fiction: The force of \squo{the Light} is not known to actually exist. 





\subsubsection{The Peoples}
The \Imrathi{} were \hr{Imrathi nomads}{nomads}. 

Or rather: 
Cordos Vaimon's people were a nomadic tribe, mongol-like but with lower technology. 
Silqua's people wre settled farmers, Ancient Egypt-style. 
The two peoples were occasionally at war, but also had peaceful relations. 

Cordos wanted to unite the two peoples and build a great empire. 
Or maybe his predecessor (as chieftain/king) wanted this, and Cordos inherited the ambition. 

Compare Cordos to Waldemar Selig from \cite{JacquelineCarey:KushielsDart}, except good rather than evil. 






\subsubsection{Sexuality}
\target{Sexuality at Cordos' time}
Both peoples were sexually liberal and had sex left and right. 
Silqua was a professional courtesan who had lots of sex, sometimes for political reasons. 
Compare her to \PhedreNoDelaunay{} from \cite{JacquelineCarey:KushielsLegacy}. 









\subsubsection{Technology}
At this point, technology is low. 
Compare to Ancient Egypt the like. 





\subsubsection{Slavery}
The \Imrathi keep thralls. 
They are chiefly prisoners of war. 







\subsection{\Banelords{} covet \ps{\Eryal} \carcer}
\target{Banelords wanted to use Eryal's Carcer}
The \banelords{} were formulating their \hr{Sephirah plan}{\sephirah{} plan}. 
They wanted to create a giant \hr{Carcer}{\carcer}, big enough to rip asunder the Shroud. 
But they needed to do more research. 
They wanted to study the \malachim{} and their \hr{Malachim binding souls}{power to bind souls}. 

This power was especially strong in \hr{Eryal}{\Eryal}, because of her \hr{Eryal binding souls}{attractive personality}. 
The \banelords{}, by a stroke of luck, had been able to determine from the \matrices{} that \Eryal{} would soon incarnate (as Silqua, it would turn out), so they started planning. 
They wanted to set her up to bind a lot of souls and study her to see how it worked. 

So they ordered their Cabalists to get to work manipulating Silqua and Cordos-tachi. 









\subsection{\Resphan{} Xanatos Gambit}
The book opens with some \resphain{} discussing their plans. 

A \TiphredSerah{} \resvil: 
\ta{Here is my idea: A child messiah.
  An innocent young girl chosen by the gods to save the world.}

And from there they went on to plan and railroad Silqua's entire life and career. 
She was a \trope{XanatosSucker}{Xanatos Sucker} and intended as a bit of a deconstruction of the \quo{chosen saviour} archetype. 

The Cabal wanted to seize control of the Vaimons and use them to create a \resphan-backed evil empire. 

Gradually, the \resvil{} started developing an attachment to Silqua and feeling like a mother to her. 
After all, Silqua was so sweet that once you got to know her you could not help but love her. 
The \resvil{} was devastated when \hr{Silqua dies}{Silqua was killed}. 





\subsubsection{\Cishiel{} was there}
\Cishiel{} was one of the masterminds behind the Vaimon project. 
She was slightly sadistic and enjoyed putting Silqua through torture. 
When she and the others discussed how to manipulate Silqua's fate, \Cishiel{} would often try to make her suffer some more. 
\hr{Cishiel hates Eryal}{She hated \Eryal}. 

A few times \Cishiel{} would assume \human{} form and have SM sex with Silqua, where she cruelly tortures her. 

But remember to make \Cishiel{} sympathetic, not just evil. 





\subsubsection{Early Vaimons overpowered}
\target{Early Vaimons overpowered}
The early Vaimons were more powerful than they should be. 
Their immortal patrons stood directly behind them and empowered them with direct help whenever they needed it. 
The Vaimons needed this power in order to \hr{Cordos vanquishes monsters}{vanquish the pre-\human monsters}. 

But occasionally one of the important pawns would get lost and somehow severed from her patrons, and the patrons would scramble about trying to regain touch. 

Several of the early Vaimons were secretly Cabalists. 
These acted as advisors who made sure to push Silqua and Cordos-tachi in the right direction. 





\subsubsection{It went wrong}
The Silqua gambit ended up going astray because the Cabal was still newly formed and the different factions fought much against each other. 
Plus, the Sentinels were working against them. 
This chaos gave \Delphine free reins to have her love affair with Silqua, which became more and more depraved and ended with her killing Silqua. 















\section{Silqua and Cordos (\yds{Silqua birth})}









\subsection{Silqua (\yds{Silqua birth})}
The history of the \VaimonCaliphate begins with \hr{Silqua}{Silqua \Delaen}, the daughter of \hr{Maegon Delain}{Maegon \Delaen}, a noble in the \human{} kingdom of \hr{Imrath}{\Imrath}. 
She has two older brothers, \hs{Arcan} and \hs{Lestor}. 

As a young girl, Silqua is very intelligent and reads many books. 
She is religious and believes in the Light and the \sephiroth.\footnote{Are the \Sephiroth{} an accepted part of dogma at this time, or does Silqua invent them?}

At an age of 18 or so, Silqua is wed to Cordos Vaimon, the firstborn son of King Belandos Vaimon II and heir to the throne of \Imrath. 
(Cordos already has one wife, \Delphine.) 
She eventually learns to love him. 









\subsection{Silqua and Cordos meet}
Silqua and Cordos met for the first time early in the story. 
They fell in love, sort of. 
Her feelings would evolve and grow and deepen over the course of more than a year before they met again. 









\subsection{Cordos and his title}
\quo{Vaimon} is a title that Cordos is awarded. 
It is given to him by \Delphine{} (the oracle-type mystic) after some major accomplishment. 
It means \quo{conqueror} or something like that. 









\subsection{Cordos vanquishes monsters}
\target{Cordos vanquishes monsters}
At this time, \Miith{} was still dominated by \quo{inhuman} powers: 
Gods, immortals, aliens and monsters. 
The \hs{Unspoken Covenant} was still a new thing and not everyone followed it. 
It was still an \quo{\hs{Age of Gods}}. 

On \Azmith, Cordos Vaimon got chosen by the Cabal as a \quo{champion} to drive away the dominant monsters and nonhumans and usher in a new aera: 
A \quo{\Human{} Age}. 
In time he came to see himself as such a champion, too. 

Cordos and Silqua would spearhead the newborn Iquinian religion, using their formidable Vaimon magic. 
In the end, \Azmith{} ended up under \human{} dominance, with the \scathae{} being mostly subjugated. 
The Vaimons fought and vanquished the evil pre-\human{} monsters. 

In those days, the early Vaimons were \hr{Early Vaimons overpowered}{overpowered} because the \resphain helped them. 

Compare to many of Robert Howard's stories, where triumphant Man vanquishes the evil pre-\human{} monsters. 
Especially \cite{RobertEHoward:TheShadowKingdom}. 

Also compare to how the T'lan Imass wage a war of genocide against the Jaghut in \cite{StevenEriksonIanCameronEsslemont:MalazanBookoftheFallen}. 

Cordos was a Conan/Kull-like hero. 
Silqua was also a Robert-Howard-esque princess/heroine. 

Remember, though, that the true story of Cordos and Silqua can be \emph{vastly} different from the official story later told by the Iquinians. 
The Cabal-backed church can have twisted and forged the story like crazy. 









\subsection[Byakun]{\Byakun}
\Byakun was a dark priest who lived in Silqua's time. 
He was a dark mage and very feared. 
Silqua's people were afraid of him. 

Compare him to various Lovecraft figures. 

At some point, Silqua (somehow) heroically volunteered to be sold to \Byakun as a slave. 
She did some hero work, and Cordos came in and saved her. 

Compared to the Mahrkagir in \cite{JacquelineCarey:KushielsAvatar}, who takes \Phedre as a slave. 










\subsection{\Delphine}
\Delphine, despite what I may have written earlier, was not an enemy of Cordos and Silqua. 
She was an aloof, oracle-like mentor type whom Cordos-tachi had to ask for help. 






\subsubsection{\ps{\Delphine}{} sexuality}
A theme of these books is the contrasting sexuality of the two Scions, Silqua and \Delphine{}. 
% : Where Silqua has principles of love and marriage and fears sex to some extent, 

\Delphine{} uses sex as a meants to become free, contact her true, inner power and escape the devouring emptiness that haunts her. 

This haunting is a manifestation of the \pps{\banes}{} fear of \hr{Entropy}{decay and stagnation}. 
Sex is a way to escape from stagnation and bring change and new creation. But the entire existence of the \banes{} is evil, destructive and parasitic. 
The \resphain{} have inherited this nature, and this is reflected in their sexuality. \Shiaraid{} is just a particularly obvious example. 

Note that natural sex, based on the chaotic power of the Heart of \Miith{}, is still wild and violent. But \resphan{} sex is worse. 









\subsection{Silqua's marriage and Vaimon career}
Silqua was a sweet and innocent girl who tried her best to do good in the world with the power she had. 
At first, she believed her power to be a beautiful gift from the gods. 

\citebandsong{Nightwish:AngelsFallFirst}{Nightwish}{Astral Romance}{
  Macrocosm poured its powers on me\\
  and the hopes of this world I now must leave...
}

At some point, Silqua was given as a gift to Cordos Vaimon to unite the two peoples. 
This was \emph{after} she had discovered her magic. 

She tried to pull Cordos in a good direction, but many forces were pulling him (and her), and he leaned in a darker direction that she would have liked. 
She became sad. 

She loved Cordos, but found herself more and more estranged from him. 
She grieved.

\citebandsong{Nightwish:AngelsFallFirst}{Nightwish}{Astral Romance}{
  The distance of our bridal bed\\
  awaits for me to be dead.\\
  Dust of the galaxies, take my hand, \\
  lead me to my beloved's land.
}









\subsection{Silqua discovers \iquin{} and \itzach}
Somehow, Silqua discovers \iquin{} and \nieur{}. 
She believes that \iquin{} is the Light which her religion worships. 
She learns how to channel \iquin{} and thus cast magic. 
When this is discovered, Silqua is accused of practicing evil \dragoncraft. 
But she convinces Cordos that she is really good, that the magic she has discovered is truly the manifestation of the Light. 
She teaches a number of people to channel \iquin{}. 
These include Arcan, Lestor, \Delphine and possibly Cordos Vaimon. 
She also teaches them to detect and recognize \nieur{}, but not to channel it. 

Silqua herself believes that she is the Prophet of the Light, born to bring knowledge of the Light to \Miith{}. She also discovers \nieur{}, the force of Darkness. She believes that \nieur{} contains all that is evil and must be shunned. 





\subsubsection{Why Silqua awakens}
Silqua's burgeoning powers are awakened by her sex life, her career as a prostitute. 
Her continuous sexual submission to the whims of her masters awakens dim memories of her past life, where she was \ps{\Shiaraid} submissive lover. 
But only vague, emotional memories. 
Never any concrete thoughts. 
Silqua never remembers her identity. 

But a link to her true self has been established. 
She has vague visions and \dejavus. 
And her powers grow. 
She slowly approaches \hr{Apotheosis}{\Apotheosis}. 





\subsubsection{Healing: Her first magic}
The first magic that Silqua learns is healing. 
She needs it to heal herself after sexual torture. 










\subsection{Silqua feels angels}
\target{Silqua feels angels}
She feels the presence of some good angels who watch over her and protect her. 

\citebandsong{Nightwish:AngelsFallFirst}{Nightwish}{Angels Fall First}{
  An angel face smiles to me\\
  under a headline of tragedy.\\
  This smile used to give me warmth.
}

These angels were actually the \Kezeradi. 
They knew that she was an amnesiac \malach, but they also knew that she was not fully evil and had been somewhat sympathetic to their cause. 
They hoped to sway her to their cause and, through her, create a good empire on \Miith{}, where peace and goodness could reign. 

The \Sephiroth{} that Silqua felt were the original \Kezeradi{} \Sephiroth, before they were corrupted by the other \resphain. 

But the plan was interrupted. The evil \resphain{} invaded and destroyed \Kezerad, twisted the \Sephiroth{} into abominations, and usurped the \ps{\Kezeradi}{} gentle quest.

}

This happened late in Silqua's life. 
Before, she had had premonitions, evil dreams and visions that this was going to happen\dash although she didn't understand it, since she didn't quite know who the angels were. 
She only knew that there was a conflict between light and dark angels. And she was afraid of her premonitions. 




\subsubsection{She sees hints of darker powers}
She also receives vague visions telling about how there exist powers far darker and far more evil than the angels.

      That shift the scenery to and fro,\\
  Flapping from out their Condor wings\\
      Invisible Woe!
}





\subsubsection{Premonitions of the fall of \Kezerad}
She sees premonitions of the \hr{Fall of Kezerad}{fall of \Kezerad}. 
She sees them at war with the \Baelzerach{} (commanding \xsic{} powers and \daemonic{} servants), and later with the Cabalist \resphain{} (with \banes{} in their armies). 

\citeauthorbook{EdgarAllanPoe:TheConquerorWorm}{Edgar Allan Poe}{The Conqueror Worm}{
  But see, amid the mimic rout\\
      A crawling shape intrude!\\
  A blood-red thing that writhes from out\\

      The mimes become its food,\\
  And seraphs sob at vermin fangs\\

}

She sees what she interpets as the \quo{end of the world}:

\citeauthorbook{EdgarAllanPoe:TheConquerorWorm}{Edgar Allan Poe}{The Conqueror Worm}{
  Out\dash out are the lights\dash out all!\\
      And, over each quivering form,\\

  While the angels, all pallid and wan,\\
      Uprising, unveiling, affirm\\
  That the play is the tragedy, \quo{Man},\\
      And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
}

What she sees is actually the fall of \Kezerad{} and the fall of \humanity{} into slavery under the yoke of the corrupt, Cabal-controlled \VaimonCaliphate. 
A defeat for freedom and a failure for the \Kezeradi{} attempt to break free of the eternal \Feud. 

But people after Silqua's time don't understand this. 
They believe that her visions refer to some \quo{Doomsday} that will come in the far future. 
They don't know that it has \emph{already happened}. 

I ought to write Silqua's prophecy in archaic language, like the \emph{King James Bible}. 









\subsection{Silqua and \Delphine}
\target{Silqua and Delphine were lovers}
Silqua and \Delphine{} met and fell in love. 
They sort of had to; Silqua was \Aryal{} and \Delphine{} was \Shiaraid. 
They were lovers before, so when they met again those feelings awakened. 

They did not have sex at first. 
But at some point, Cordos Vaimon desired \ps{\Delphine} allegiance. 
\Delphine{} demanded to get Silqua as a gift in return. 
Cordos would not \emph{give} her away. 
But Silqua \emph{wanted} to be given away. 
(This was partially her self-sacrificing heroism and partially because she was attracted to \Delphine{}.)
So after some negotiation, \Delphine{} was haggled down until she accepted simply \emph{borrowing} Silqua as a sex slave for a while. 

They became lesbian lovers. 

Silqua was attracted, but she also feared \Delphine. 
She subconsciously remembered how abusive \Delphine{} had become, and \hr{Shiaraid and Eryal break up}{how ugly their break-up had been}. 

\Delphine{} genuinely loved Silqua. 
But her mind was being twisted by \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse}, and her \hr{Self-destructive Shiaraid}{self-destructive madness} made her abusive and evil and drove them apart. 











\subsection{Silqua and \Delphine{} have visions}
Both Silqua and \Delphine{} have dark visions of the angels.

\Delphine{} dreams of her past life as a \resvil.

\Delphine{} wants to know more of these visions, and of her own identity.

}









\subsection{Silqua becomes sick}
Silqua uses Vaimon magic. 
Recall that \hr{Parasitic Archons}{the \Archons{} are parasitic}. 
There are no Iquinians at this time, so Silqua herself bears the full brunt of the evil inherent in \Iquin. 
This means that she is often sick and weak and in pain. 














\section{Imperial Ambitions}
At some point, Belandos II dies and Cordos becomes king. He is quick to see the potential of Silqua's discovery and goes about organizing all believers of the Light into a single religious state. He manages to unite a large kingdom. Religious fervor is the key here, not the power of the magic itself. Silqua is a scientific genius and develops a lot of spells and techniques, but \iquin{}-\nieur{} magic is newly discovered, so all their spells are still primitive and somewhat weak. But the really important part is that Silqua's \iquin{} magic proves that the Light truly exists, and that she is its Prophet. 

Cordos desires to rule an empire, so he wages war on neighbouring kingdoms, \scathaese{} and \human{} alike. %Silqua initially approves of his war against the \scathae{}, since she has been raise to believe that the Creeps are evil monsters. 
Silqua initially approves, but along the way she begins to question whether war and conquest is the will of the Light. 









\subsection{Diplomacy and conquest alike}
The \VaimonCaliphate was not built through conquest alone, but even more so through diplomacy and religious propaganda.
History and legend later emphasized both Cordos' heroism in war and conquest and Silqua's gentle charisma. 
The truth was much more complex than that. 

















\section{It Goes Downhill (\yds{Silqua death})}
\subsection{\Kezerad{} falls, \iquin{} rises}
Fair \Kezerad{} is destroyed and the cruel \iquin{} is created. 

The last \Kezeradi{} behold the newborn, evil \iquin.

}









\subsection{Silqua is raped and broken}
Silqua is taken captive by her enemies. 
She is cruelly raped and tortured. 
Her enemies want to break her spirit and turn her into their slave, make her worship her rapists and tormentors. 
Compare to \cite{GeorgeOrwell:1984}. 

This is necessary in order to fully and thoroughly corrupt and infest \iquin. 
See, Silqua is bound to \iquin. 
She is the mightiest of all the souls bound to \iquin. 
\Aryal{} is \Kezeradi{}, remember. 
Perhaps also a \sathariah, and perhaps one of the mightiest \resviel{} ever. 

They almost succeed, but she is rescued in the end. 
She is badly traumatized after this, though. 

Or maybe she channels \nieur{} and kills a bandit, but is horrified by her actions. 
This leaves her traumatized, and she develops an irrational fear of both \nieur{} and sex.

}





\subsubsection{The fall of \Kezerad{} scars her}
When \Kezerad{} finally fell and the \Sephiroth{} were corrupted and enslaved, Silqua went mad. 
Perhaps this happened while she was captured by the enemy, or perhaps her madness \emph{made} her fall into enemy hands. 
After this, she was raped, tortured and finally killed. 








\subsection{Silqua becomes more morbid}
Later in her career, Silqua's visions take a turn for the darker, more morbid. 
This has two reasons: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item She begins to have premonitions of the bloody \hr{Fall of Kezerad}{fall of \Kezerad}.
  \item She has suffered terrible things in her life (rape and torture) which have made her traumatized and warped, so she sees everything through her own gradually more twisted mind. 
\end{itemize}

\hs{Silqua and Delphine were lovers}, but \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse} fucked them up. 
Eventually \Delphine{} was driven to kill Silqua and \hr{soul-eating}{eat her soul}. 

Silqua submitted completely and gave herself up willingly. 
She loved \Delphine{} and would do anything to make her happy. 
So she said: 
\ta{Kill me. And devour my soul. That way we will always be together.}

(\hr{Shroud prevents soul destruction}{It would not have been possible} for \Delphine{} to eat Silqua's sould without permission. She would have to be more powerful.)

But devouring Silqua brought \Delphine{} no happiness. 
It only added to her tragedy and quickened her descent into madness. 









\subsection{Silqua's afterlife}
\target{Silqua as a ghost}
At some point, Silqua dies a martyr, killed by her enemies.

After her death, \hr{Monuments keeping the dead imprisoned}{her soul lingers on as a powerless, suffering ghost}, mourning how what she thought to be her work has been taken from her and corrupted into something dark.

Compare to the RPG \emph{Kult}.

\citelimbonicart{AdNoctum}{The Supreme Sacrifice}{

\subsubsection{Move this to \Delphine}
If \hr{Silqua dies}{\Delphine{} devoured Silqua's soul}, then Silqua had no afterlife. 
She was simply \emph{gone}. 

If that was the case, then it was \Delphine{} who, in her new grief, started to see the evil that the Vaimon order and the \VaimonCaliphate were being turned into. 
She mourned even as the Vaimons raped, tortured and killed her. 









\subsection{Lestor rapes \Delphine}
\target{Lestor rapes Delphine}
This whole scene below is portrayed from \ps{\Delphine} point of view. 

\Delphine{} was responsible for Silqua's death. 
Cordos Vaimon sent Lestor \Delaen out to capture her alive and bring her justice. 
Lestor brought her alive, but not unharmed. 

Lestor's men defeated \ps{\Delphine}{} soldiers and broke into her sanctum. 
They barged into her room. 
She was outnumbered. 
But she held her head up high. 
She was wracked with guilt and sorrow, but she was not about to show it in the presence of these people, and she had never liked Lestor in the first place. 
So she met him defiantly. 

Lestor ordered his men to hold her suppressed so she could cast no magic. 

Lestor (to his men, with his eyes meeting \ps{\Delphine}): 
\ta{Do you have her suppressed?}

Vaimon soldiers: \ta{Yes, sir.}

Lestor went up to \Delphine{} and bitchslapped her across the face, fucking hard. 
She knew Lestor was rough, but she was unprepared for this direct brutality. 
She fell over. 

Lestor: 
\ta{What? 
  Are you going to crawl on the floor before me like the dog you are? 
  [\hr{Shiaraid's dogs}{\Shiaraid{} has always liked dogs}, remember.]
  Or will you stand and face me?}

\Delphine{} climbed to her feet. 

Lestor struck her again. 
This time she was more prepared. 
She staggered but remained standing. 

Lestor told \Delphine{} to kneel. 
She obeyed, and remained kneeling through their discussion. 
But she sat up as straight as she could. 
As proud and unbowed as any queen. 
Or so she hoped. 

\Delphine: 
\ta{Does it really give you such pleasure, beating a defenseless woman?
  You are no better than I, Lestor \Delaen. 
  This childish display of power proves it.
  So do not play holy and righteous with me.}

They had a longer discussion about who was right and wrong, good and evil. 
Compare to the discussion between Melisande Shahrizai and Ysandre de la Courcel in \cite[p.622]{JacquelineCarey:KushielsAvatar}. 

At last Lestor gave up: 
\ta{Maybe you are right, \Delphine. 
  Maybe I am as bad as you, or worse.
  Maybe we are both animals.
  All right, you win.}

She smiled. 
She felt happy inside. 
She had won a small victory. 

He looked at her with a vicious, twisted, hungry look in his eyes. 
She became uneasy, began to fidget. 
\tho{What is wrong with him? Why is he looking at me like that?}
He sat there for a long moment. 
She became afraid. 

Lestor: 
\ta{In fact, let me show you how right you are.
  Let me show you what an animal I am.}

He then had her stripped naked and tied to her bed. 
Then he raped and tortured her. 

\ta{You tortured Silqua and enjoyed it. 
  I intend to do the same to you.}


Lestor raped her multiple times, and let his men do the same. 
She was badly broken when he finally brought her to Cordos. 

\target{Delphine's guilt}
\Delphine{} did not fight back as much as she could have done. 
She blamed herself for killing Silqua. 
She knew that was wrong. 
She did not want to admit it in front of Lestor-tachi, so she put up a proud and defiant front (brought on, again, in part by her pride and self-destructive perversion), but inside she hated the monster she had become. 
So she was almost glad to be brutally raped, tortured, humiliated and ultimately killed (in a slow, painful and humiliating manner). 
\tho{It is no more than I deserve.} 










\subsection{Legacy of Silqua and \Delphine}
It became known that Silqua willingly let \Delphine{} kill her. 
This got posthumously interpreted as a divine sacrifice. 
Compare to the fake sacrifice of Serena Butler in \cite{BrianHerbert:LegendsofDune}. 
But in reality Silqua did it for \Delphine{} and out of her own weakness and sexual desire, not out of any large-scale moral (let alone religious) motivation. 

Silqua became mythed up to be an incarnation of \iquin{} on \Miith{}. 
No one knew what a Scion was back then.
Later, when it was discovered that Scions existed, Iquinians still believed Silqua was no Scion but something greater. 
(And that even though \Aryal{} was a measly \thelyad.) 

\Delphine{} got the status of an evil manifestation of \itzach, the antithesis of Silqua and a terrible Dark Lord. 





\subsubsection{Vaimons become scared of sex}
Silqua died under perverted circumstances, killed by the sexy \Delphine. 
And then Lestor \Delaen brutally raped \Delphine{} in retaliation. 
These nasty sex acts scared and scarred the Vaimons (Cordos, Arcan and others). 

They developed traumata surrounding sexual liberated-ness. 
As the years and generations went by, this only became worse. 
The \VaimonCaliphate became sexually restrictive. 















\section{\Caliphate (\yds{VC})}
Silqua dies. 

Cordos Vaimon continues his conquest and eventually comes to rule a great empire. This becomes the \VaimonCaliphate.

The \hr{Vaimon clan}{\VaimonClans} were founded here. 
























\chapter{\HundredScourgesBook}
The Darkfall, the destruction of the \VaimonCaliphate, begins with \Belzir{} daughter of \Cormin, a young Vaimon girl of \ClanGeican. As a girl, \Belzir{} is a nerd, an skinny, unattractive girl who fails to attract the attentions of boys and thus devotes her life to science and magic. She is a genius, with great talent for magic, especially \nieur{}, and already at a young age she discovers several new Kliffoth and new techniques to channel \iquin{} and \nieur{}, making her very powerful. 

At some point, \Belzir{} is chosen to become \Calipha. So she is schooled in all the things that an \Calipha must know, including all sorts of social relations. Despite the shortcomings she used to display in these areas, she learns quickly and becomes an adept communicator and a sly manipulator. But she still has problems attracting men, and the men she does attract seek her out for her position or her power. This is not enough for \Belzir; she wants them to desire her body. So she does a lot of research, and eventually manages to magically and permanently change her body, sculpting herself into the most beautiful and desirable woman she can imagine. 

What is \Belzir's relationship with the Cabal? Is she affiliated with it? Maybe the Cabal manipulates her into destroying the \caliphate because the Iquinian Church is a threat to them...

\subsection[Scatha rebellion]{\Scatha rebellion}
\target{Scatha rebellion under Belzir}
The \VaimonCaliphate \hr{Vaimon Caliphate oppressed Scathae}{oppressed \scathae}. 
In \Belzir's time there was a \scathaese (\Ortaican) uprising that had been brewing for centuries. 
Everything \Belzir did interacted with this rebellion. 
The rebellion was as important as \Belzir, if not more so, in bringing about the end of the \caliphate. 
But afterwards \Belzir was demonized because the surviving \VaimonClans wanted a scapegoat. 









\subsection{Technology}
\target{Vaimon technology}
At this point, technology is high. 
Renaissance level. 
Think \quo{Pirate Age} or \quo{Musketeer Age}, or even \quo{Zorro Age}. 





\subsubsection{Flying machines}
They even have magical flying machines. 





\subsubsection{Weapons}
\target{Vaimon guns}
Stories tell of how mighty and glorious the Vaimons were with their magic, but they were actually more vulnerable back then than they are in Carzain's day. 

See, the technology was higher back then. 
There were guns, which could quite easily snipe off a Vaimon from a distance. 
(Protective measures like \hr{Archon Ward}{Archon Wards} were extremely expensive and rare.) 

After the \HundredScourges, knowledge of magic (seen as the highest and noblest of all sciences) was mostly preserved, but all other technology suffered. 
This had the side effect of making Vaimons more effective compared to non-mages. 









\subsection{\VaimonClans}
\target{Vaimon Clans at Belzir's time}
At \Belzir's time there were four \VaimonClans:

As a young teenage girl (of legal age), \Belzir was haunted by dark shades and monsters.

  But princess Yasmela lolled not on that silken bed. She lay naked on her supple belly upon the bare marble like the most abased suppliant, her dark hair streaming over her white shoulders, her slender fingers intertwined. She lay and writhed in pure horror that froze the blood in her lithe limbs and dilated her beautiful eyes, that pricked the roots of her dark hair and made goose-flesh rise along her supple spine.
  
  Above her, in the darkest corner of the marble chamber, lurked a vast shapeless shadow. It was no living thing of form or flesh and blood. It was a clot of darkness, a blur in the sight, a monstrous night-born incubus that might have been deemed a figment of a sleep-drugged brain, but for the points of blazing yellow fire that glimmered like two eyes from the blackness.
  
  Moreover, a voice issued from it\dash a low subtle inhuman sibilance that was more like the soft abominable hissing of a serpent than anything else, and that apparently could not emanate from anything with human lips. Its sound as well as its import filled Yasmela with a shuddering horror so intolerable that she writhed and twisted her slender body as if beneath a lash, as though to rid her mind of its insinuating vileness by physical contortion.
  
  \ldots 
  
  The ghostly hissing dwindled off in lustful titterings, and Yasmela moaned and beat the marble tiles with her small fists in her ecstasy of terror.

  Before the stream of cosmic obscenity which poured from the shadowy colossus, Yasmela cringed and writhed as if from a whip that flayed her dainty bare flesh.
   
  \ta{Remember!} whispered the horror. 
  \ta{The days will not be many before I come to claim mine own!}
   
  Yasmela, pressing her face against the tiles and stopping her pink ears with her dainty fingers, yet seemed to hear a strange sweeping noise, like the beat of bat wings. Then, looking fearfully up, she saw only the moon that shone through the window with a beam that rested like a silver sword across the spot where the phantom had lurked. Trembling in every limb, she rose and staggered to a satin couch, where she threw herself down, weeping hysterically.

\subsubsection{Angst}
The young \Belzir angsted over being haunted by the dead souls of her \carcer. 

\citebandsong{BlindGuardian:IFTOS}{Blind Guardian}{I'm Alive}{
  Was it really me I saw in the mirror screaming? \\
  I swallowed hate and lies through a thousand cries\\

  From the mirror's other side\\
  Reflecting the cruel part of your soul\\
  It's time for your choice
  
  What can I do on this road to nowhere?\\
  Heart of dragon lies\\
  At the edge of time
  
  And the story ends\\
  Insanity said coldly\\
  Still waiting for the chance\\
  So out of nowhere it will rise\\
  Oh, and another journey starts\\
  By the call of the moon

\subsection{\Belzir disgruntled}
\Belzir{} was not always pleased with her position as \Calipha and people's expectations of her. 

She tried hard all her life to reconcile herself with the Iquinian religion, but it always felt distasteful to her. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Homecoming}{
  I have tried so hard\\
  to regain my faith in man.\\
  Yet, I fail again\\
  to uphold this deception.\\

Instead she found herself drawn towards the darkness, the unknown, the scary and exciting. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Homecoming}{
  I return instead \\

  and say:\\
  \quo{Unutterable and nameless\\

}

When she realized that the Iquinian religion was the Cabal's work, she hated the \resphain{} for having resurrected a version of the hated \Merkyran{} faith, which they had fought so hard to overthrow. 





\subsubsection{Flees from her castle}
She flees from her castle at night and explores the countryside and her magical skills.

\subsection{She learns vampirism and regains some power}
\Belzir{} re-learns the skill of absorbing souls. 
This helps her regain a portion of her \sathariah{} powers and even some of her memory. 





\subsubsection{Vampirism makes her beautiful}
She becomes extra beautiful when she drinks blood. 
This is because her \resvil{} self shines through, and \humans{} pick up on it and feel an inbred urge to serve and worship her. 

\citebandsong{CradleofFilth:CrueltyandtheBeast}{Cradle of Filth}{Beneath the howling stars}{

}









\subsection{Her memories slowly return}
\ps{\Belzir}{} memories slowly returned to her. 
She did not develop a split personality like Ramiel would have done. 
She just remembered vague emotional impressions of her past lives. 
She has strange dreams, thoughts and fantasies which she shouldn't have. 
She feels there must be a bigger picture, a meaning behind it all. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers}{
  Ever behind me\\
  rises a shadow.\\
  Taller than I,\\
  yet with a certain resemblance.

She feels she is missing out on some greatness and pleasure that could and should rightly be hers.

  How many times do I \\
  have to contemplate my own reflection\\
  and say: I have been blind?
  
  I have been blind,\\

}

Through the story she comes closer to a revelation of it all. 
But her own fear and religious conditioning hold her back. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers}{
  Every time I am bound \\
  to have been granted\\
  the gift of better sight.
  
  But my anxiety built one more brick.\\

}

There is power in her memories, but also weaknesses. 
Fears. 
Vulnerability. 
Even gods have vulnerabilities. 
Realizing this helps her identify with \Shiaraid{} and achieve her \apotheosis. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers}{
  Vaguely I remember\\
  the blurred eyes of someone small.\\
  These strangers often come as blind.\\
  A troubled mind I left behind.

}









\subsection{Caught between two plans}
There was a Cabal plan unfolding around her at court. 
The Cabalists were trying to reawaken \Shiaraid. 
But at the same time she was being corrupted and seduced by the Sentinels. 

When she learns of the Cabal plan she feels betrayed and turns on them. 

When she regains some of her memory she sees the \VaimonCaliphate as a new \Merkyrah, a betrayal of the principles she fought for in the original rebellion. 
As a \Mystraacht, in touch with Chaos, she sees it as her duty to rebel once again against oppression and stupidity. 

Slowly, her half-awakening and her chaotic memories drive her mad. 
The \Malach{} reawakening experiment fails. 





\subsubsection{\Secherdamon and the \taorthae}
\target{Taorthae manipulate Belzir}
\target{Rissit helps set up Belzir}
The war surrounding \Belzir and the ensuing \HundredScourges were partially masterminded by the \taorthae, who were just emerging at this time. 
They had a long-term plan to destroy the Vaimons, and they realized they could employ this rebellious \Calipha to their own ends. 

\Secherdamon was one of the \taorthae who manipulated \Belzir.
Shortly before this, he had \hr{Secherdamon takes the name Nexagglachel}{taken the name \quo{\Nexagglachel}}.

\Ortaican mythology would later \hr{Ortaican myths about the Hundred Scourges}{exaggerate their role}. 
As \hr{Rissitic myths about Belzir}{would the Rissitics}. 









\subsection{She has evil dreams}
Just like Carzain and Vizicar, \Belzir{} is haunted by nightmares of her past. 

\citebandsong{CradleofFilth:CrueltyandtheBeast}{Cradle of Filth}{Desire in Violent Overture}{
  Frights came wailing from the Darkside.\\
  Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes.\\

  How sleep the pure?\\
  Desire in violent overture.
}









\subsection{She likes nature}
\Belzir{}, and \Shiaraid{} in general, has always been fascinated by nature. 
Young \Belzir{} sneaks out of the castle to experience nature. 
Through this she discovers part of her own true nature. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Into the Infinity of Thoughts}{
  As the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway \\
  and the silence reach the woods, I awake and rise... \\
  Into the night I wander, like many nights before, \\

  Into the Infinity of Darkness, \\
  beyond the light of a new day, \\

  the Shadows calling... 
  
  I gaze into the Moon which grants me visions \\
  these twelve full Moon nights of the year, \\
  and for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away.

  makes my mind pure as crystal lakes, \\
  my eyes cold as the darkest winter nights, \\
  but yet there is a flame inside. 
  
  It guides me into the dark \\
  shadows beyond this world, \\
  into the infinity of thoughts... \\
  thoughts of upcoming reality.
}

She dreams of her past. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{The Burning Shadows of Silence}{

  atmosphere of melancholy. \\
  I will forever burn...
}









\subsection{She goes mad}
Her \Malach{} memories drive her somewhat mad. 
She begins to have morbid fantasies. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Into the Infinity of Thoughts}{
  The lands will grow black. \\
  There is no Sunrise yet to come \\
  into the wastelands of phantoms lost. 
  
  May these moments under the Moon be eternal. \\
  May the infinity haunt me... In Darkness.
}









\subsection{She rebels against religious oppression}
Much of the story is about \ps{\Belzir}{} rebellion in the face of religious oppression and bigotry. 
In a sense, a \quo{light} version of the \Merkyran{} rebellion. 

She becomes disgruntled and disillusioned with the religious Vaimons around her. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{Decrystallizing Reason}{

She discovers the truth about the Vaimons and the way the Cabal is controlling them. 
She even has a clue about \iquin.

\subsubsection{Geicans were religious}
\target{Geicans were religious}
At this point, \ClanGeican was religious and Iquinian.
It was \Belzir{} that introduced the atheist philosophy, and her son \hs{Zacrias} carried it on. 





\subsubsection{Geicans are greedy and materialistic}
Apart from being religious, \ClanGeican (and perhaps all Vaimons) are also hypocritical. \ShiinMerodar{} is corrupt, a cesspool of hypocrisy, bureaucracy and greed. I need to underline the avarice, pettiness and treacherousness of the Geicans. 

Have a named guild of politicians, lawyers and the like (\quo{\DJOF'ers}\footnote{\quo{\DJOF} is Danish for \quo{Danske Juristers og \O konomers Forbund} (or something like that), the \quo{Danish Lawyers' and Economists' Association}.}), who are made the scapegoats and blamed for the corruption of Geica, by virtue (or vice) of the materialistic world view they spread. 

Compare to the Letherii culture in \SEMalazan, and especially Chancellor Triban Gnol and Invigilator Karos Invictad. 

Perhaps the Geicans own no slaves, only life-long indentured serfs. Compare to the Indebted in Lether. 

Belzir wants something greater, something nobler and more beautiful than this.

\subsubsection{She makes social improvements}
She is a cruel and decadent tyrant, but she also introduces some genuine improvements in society. 
She removed some evil, repressive rules and tried to make the empire more free. 
She was popular in certain circles among the people. 









\subsection{\ps{\Belzir}{} idols}
She is inspired by some of the mighty and controversial Dark Vaimons in history and legend. 

She is especially fascinated with \Delphine. 
Only later does she realize that she \emph{is} \Delphine. 
This puts everything into perspective and further strengthens her conviction. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:IXEquilibrium}{Emperor}{An Elegy of Icaros}{
  Icaros, your voice once melted\\

\subsection{\Belzir{} reads Vizicar's notes}
\target{Belzir reads notes}
\Belzir{} discovered and read the \hr{Vizicar's notes}{notes about \Malachim} that \VizicarDurasRespina{} had written. 
She read them. 
They helped her a lot in achieving her \apotheosis. 









\subsection{\Belzir{} betrays her subordinates}
Maybe have scenes where \Belzir{} betrays her subordinates and allies and \hr{Resphan cannibalism}{eats them}. 

These should be loyal people who trust and love her, making her crime all the more heinous. 

Compare to Akasha in the movie \cite{Movie:QueenoftheDamned}.









\subsection{\Belzir{} comes to hate it all}
\Belzir{} gradually remembered her tragic past. 
She recalled how she, as \Shiaraid, once the high princess of \Mystraacht, fell into disgrace and was reviled as a villain and traitor. 
And how she then saw the \emph{same} thing happen again in her life as \Delphine. 

\Belzir, who was already heavily influenced by the Curse and the self-destructive madness it brought, became defiant, thinking: 
\ta{%
  If it is my destiny that History should curse me by all my names, then so be it. 
  By the \qliphoth, I will give History a reason to curse the name \Belzir!}

When she finally died, she was almost relieved to leave it all behind, happy to die. 
She had grown very bitter and hateful. 
Waging war against the world, hated by everyone, she did not enjoy life anymore. 
The Curse was part of the reason. 

She thought back to the time when she killed \Eryal/Silqua. 
She reflected on all the destruction and pain she had caused for everyone in her life as \Belzir. 
She reflected that the world would probably be a better place without her.

With her last strength she called out to Zacrias-tachi. 
She asked them to keep the memory of her good deeds alive. 
She did not want to be remembered solely as an evil queen, but also for her open-mindedness and her love of life.

At the end of the \HundredScourges, \Belzir{} is finally killed.

She is killed but her soul is not destroyed. 
So the Vaimons dismember and imprison her soul. 
Using powerful magic, her enemies successfully banish her soul from \Miith{} (into the darkness of \nieur{}, as the Redcor tell the story), but they fail at destroying her. In time, she learns to communicate with people on \Miith{} again and plots to return. 

As she died, she reached out, semi-consciously.

\section{The \HundredScourges (\yds{Darkfall})}
\target{Hundred Scourges}
The fall of the \VaimonCaliphate was \quo{the \HundredScourges}. 
The civil war surrounding the dethroning of \Belzir{} led to a number of calamities befalling the \caliphate. 

In the fighting, Vaimons expended huge amounts of magical energy. 
Because of \hr{Parasitic Archons}{the parasitic nature of Vaimon magic}, this resulted in a number of catastrophes. 
The Heart of \Miith{} was temporarily exhausted and could not bear to create much new life. 

\target{Belzir's Carcer unleashed}
Another cause of the Scourges was the unleashing and destruction of tons of bound souls from \hr{Belzir binding souls}{\ps{\Belzir} (formidable) \carcer}. 

The Scourges included:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Immorality (blamed on \Belzir). 
  \item Civil war. 
  \item Crime (ie., banditry).
  \item Disease (an \caliphate-wide epidemy of a leprosy-like disease). 
  \item Stillbirth. 
  \item Infertility. 
  \item Ash (defiling magic caused some vegetation to turn to ash). 
\end{enumerate}

The Scourge of Immorality is blamed on \Belzir. 
Allegedly it was her sins that brought down the anger of the \Archons, which caused all the other Scourges. 

The defeat of the Queen does not end the war. Weapons of mass destruction are used. The \caliphate is destroyed and \Miith{} bombed back several TLs. Thus end the Fourth Age. 

This wiped out many of the faithful. 

\quo{Fortunately}, the heathens had had their asses heavily kicked by \VizicarDurasRespina{} and others, so they were in no shape to sweep in and conquer the remnants of the \caliphate.

The \Ortaicans{} eventually became too evil. 
At last their Scion slave was destroyed, which lost them some of their power. 
The \Iquinian{} \hr{Tepharae}{\Tepharites} rose up in rebellion against them, and \Ortaica{} was overthrown. 









\subsection{Peaceful takeover}
The \Telcra/\Tepharin takeover was remarkably peaceful by \Miithian standards. 
There were battles and wars fought, but it was mostly a quasi-peaceful religious reformation followed by lots of diplomacy. 
For a century or two, the \Tepharin people dominated a large part of \Azmith. 
































\chapter{Iquinian creation myth}
In the beginning there was the Light. The Light was, the Light is, and the Light will be, for the Light is eternal and everlasting, the Light is without beginning and without end and without boundaries. 

Before the world there was the Light. The Light was, the Light is, and the Light will be. And the Light give birth unto the \Sephiroth{}, for the \Sephiroth{} are of the Light, and the \Sephiroth{} are comprised of the Light. Four times four is their number, and the number of the \Sephiroth{} is sixteen. 

Before the world there were the \Sephiroth. The \Sephiroth{} were, the \Sephiroth{} are, and the \Sephiroth{} will be. And the \Sephiroth{} gave birth unto the Light, for the Light is of the sixteen \Sephiroth{}, and the Light is comprised of the \Sephiroth{}, whose number is four times four. 

The \Sephiroth{} are of the Light, and the Light is of the \Sephiroth{}. The many are one, and the one is many. Four times four is the number of the \Sephiroth, and the number of the \Sephiroth{} is sixteen. The sixteen are one, and the one is sixteen. 

Before the world there was the Light which is the \Sephiroth{}. Before the world there were the \Sephiroth{} which are the Light. 

And they created the world. 

And they created the First Men. And the first men worshipped the Light and gave praise unto the \Sephiroth{}. 

But the First Men grew decadent, and they grew negligent in their worship. They became arrogant and said: \ta{We are the greatest, the fairest and the wisest creatures of \Miith{}. Why should we fear the Light? Why should we serve the \Sephiroth{} and give prayer and thanks unto them, we who are the greatest, the fairest and the wisest of all creatures of \Miith{}?} 

And so the First Men turned away from the Light, and they abandoned the worship of the \Sephiroth{}, and they, who were the greatest, the fairest and the wisest of all creatures, they fell into wickedness, and they fell into sin, and they fell into blasphemy, and they fell into idolatry. 

The First Men turned to idolatry, and they took up the worship of evil powers, and they did sin, and they did blaspheme. 

And the \Sephiroth{} saw that the First Men had broken the covenant and fallen into wickedness, and they spake, saying: \ta{The First Men are turned from us. They have broken the covenant and abandoned the Light. In turn, the Light shall abandon them. And the First Men shall know the wages of sin, and the price of their wickedness shall lay heavy upon them.}

This the \Sephiroth{} spake: \ta{As they court evil, so evil shall come upon them, and evil shall engulf them. As the First Men worship the idols of evil, so shall evil enter into the world and cause them untold woe. And the First Men shall suffer and weep and be destroyed, because they turned to idolatry. Evil shall come into the world, and evil shall fall upon them and engulf them. Evil shall torment them, and destroy them, and death shall take them. Thus the First Men shall be destroyed, because they turned from the Light. Thus have spoken we of the Light.}

And so the \Sephiroth{} did turn from the First Men. As the First Men had turned from the Light, so the Light turned from them, and they were abandoned. 

And as the Light abandoned the First Men, so it was that evil was allowed to enter the world. And forces of evil did enter the world: \Daemons{} and monsters, they came into the world that they might wreak evil. 

Of the forces of evil that came into the world, the most terrible were the \dragons. The mightiest they were, and the foulest, and the most hideous, and the most evil, and they came into the world that they might wreak evil. Foremost among the \dragons{} were their gods. They were the \Dominators, and the greatest and the most evil of the \dragons{} were they, and they were the gods of the \dragons. Five in number were they, and the number of the \Dominators{} was five, and these are their names: 

First of them is Tiamat. Vast of body is she, so that the greatest of \dragons{} is as naught beside her. Terrible is she to look upon, and six heads hath she, and from her six mouths she breatheth fire and ice and lightning and poison. Among the \dragons{} she is the Queen. Of Chaos she is the Queen. She is evil itself, and she is Chaos itself. Of all creatures of evil she is the greatest, the mightiest and the most evil. Of the creatures of evil she is the Mother, and all manner of monsters and \daemons{} and accursed things do spring from her tained womb. She is Tiamat, and of the \Dominators{} she is the first. 

Second of them is \ApepNesthra. Of colour he is white, deathly white like unto a corpse, sickly white like unto the maggots that feast upon the dead.
