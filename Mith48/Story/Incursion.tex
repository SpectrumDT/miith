This book takes place in \hr{Merkyrah}{\Merkyrah}. 















\section{The Truth (\yds{Delving})}
A few \resphain{} discover the truth of their origin.









\subsection[Prologue: Semiza]{Prologue: \Semiza}
The book opens with \Semiza, who is lying in the ground. 
Suffering, alone, decaying and unable to move. 
He sends out his mournful and patient call to the \resphain{} in their cities above him. 
His children. 
(After all, all \resphain{} descend from \Thanatzil, who is \ps{\Semiza}{} grandson.)

Compare to the titular \quo{call} in \authorbook{\HPLovecraft}{The Call of Cthulhu}. 









\subsection{Main conflicts}
There are a number of main conflicts in this book: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    The \hr{Umbra menace}{\umbra{} menace}, which was slowly killing the \resphain. 
    It was the greatest threat to their people, and governed much of their lives. 
    And \hr{Umbra menace growing}{it was growing}. 
  \item 
    The \Merkyran{} religion.
    For some it was happiness and peace and good. 
    But for others it was stagnation, oppression, asceticism, denial of all that was life. 
    Some said \emph{it} was slowly killing the \resphain.
    Some even said the religion was the reason why the \umbrae{} hunted them. 
  \item 
    Hunger. 
    The \hr{Merkyran hunters}{monsters that the \resphain{} hunt were becoming scarcer}. 
    This caused hunger and malnutrition. 
\end{enumerate}





\subsubsection{The Awakening}
\target{Awakening}
\index{Awakening}
The \resphan{} rebellion was also known as the Awakening.
The rebels believed they were Awakening from a dream, a daze, a stupour, and were now, for the first time, clear-sighted enough to understand their true nature. 










\subsection{Malcontents}
Many are discontent with life in \Merkyrah. 
They include \Kezrabal, \Gevural, \Zachirah{} and others.

\subsection{The Delving}
\target{Delving}
\index{\Delving}
\target{Resphan rebels}
After thousands of years, a few \resphain, led by \Damiarch, went on an exploring expedition. 
The motivating factors for the mission included: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Simple hunting. 
    The \resphain{} \hr{Merkyran hunters}{hunter monsters, and hunters were highly respected}. 
  \item 
    The \hr{Merkyrans fear Umbrae}{\umbra{} menace}, which was \hr{Umbra menace growing}{growing}. 
    They hoped to learn more about what the \umbrae{} were and how they could combat them. 
\end{itemize}

For astrological reasons, the \umbra{} threat was especially bad this particular year. 
\Damiarch-tachi found some traces, full of \Erebos-aligned energies, that smelled kind of like the \umbrae{} (who are also \Erebean). 
They suspected a clue, so they followed these trails to their source.
This brought them deep underground. 
As it turns out, these trails were created by \Semiza, who lay down in the earth and tried to attact some \resphain{} to him. 

This voyage would later come to be known as \emph{the \Delving}

The brave explorers (the \quo{\Delvers}) included: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Damiarch.
  \item \Gevural.
  \item \Zachirah.
  \item \Ramiel.
  \item \Shiaraid.
  \item 6-8 more. Maybe \Sithiyacaan.
\end{itemize}

Among them are several who would later become the dreaded \satharioth, including \Gevural{} (\Azraid{}) and Ramiel. 

\Gevural{} is one of the senior members, but the leader is his brother, \Damiarch. Ramiel and the rest are younger and look up to \Damiarch{} and \Gevural{} as great leaders. 

While exploring some underground ruins they discover a mystic, evil garden of twisted, distorted plants. 
Compare to the cover art of \bandalbum{Dimmu Borgir}{Godless Savage Garden}. 

\Semiza's garden and tomb were located in a region of darkness, monster-haunted and feared by all \resphain.
\Damiarch-tachi were very brave to venture there.
They believed they would have to brave this evil wasteland in order to solve the mystery of the \umbrae and enable their people to defend themselves from this menace.

There they find the tomb of \Semiza.

}





\subsubsection{Some look for meaning}
Some of the explorers, already in the early stages of the Delving, were disillusioned and looked for a new meaning to it all. 
They felt their religion was sad and pointless. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Called by the Fire}{
  The sky is clouded and grey like a mirror.\\
  Dreams of celestial bliss buried deep.\\
  An invisible web of whispers\\
  spread out over dead-end streets.\\
  Silently blessing the virtue of sleep.
}

Some were sure the religion was a lie, and that there was something more out there to be found. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Called by the Fire}{
  Every day I grow more immune to social sedatives.\\
  Every day the web is more transparent.\\
  United in fear and the comfort of reason.\\
  Illusions that we are all peers.\\
  Walking the stairs I am ever more awake.
}

There was a darker truth out there. 
They could feel it. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Called by the Fire}{
  The black cloud is beneath me,\\
  and I laugh.
}

They hated what they saw as the religion's hypocrisy and pettiness. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Citizen}{
  Citizen! Whence came your voice, your right to speak?\\
  Is there a purpose to your tongue and gnawing teeth?\\
  I ask thee; how deep and hollow is your mouth?\\
  What lie is too decayed for you to stomach?
  
  With humility and obedience\\
  you pride yourself.\\
  Evasive and lukewarm\\
  until the end.
}

Some just wanted to rebel, because they were sick of it all.

}





\subsubsection{Ramiel and \Shiaraid}
Ramiel and \Shiaraid{} are the same age. 
They are close friends. 
They are major influences on each other's lives. 

Already at this time, Ramiel and \Shiaraid{} were secret lovers. 
\quo{Secret} from society at large, that is. 
Having sex out of sanctioned marriage was a taboo. 
But their fathers, who were both free thinkers (or, at least, pragmatists), knew about their affair and accepted it. 
\Zachirah{} even encouraged it.
\Nathrach{} remained mostly stoic. 

The two should have a \quo{secret} sex scene at the beginning of the book. 

At this point, they just had normal sex, no sadomasochism involved. 
It was not until after \Semiza{} that he \hr{Ramiel develops sadism}{developed his sadism} and she \hr{Shiaraid develops sadomasochism}{developed her sadomasochism}. 









\subsection[Semiza's garden]{\Semiza's garden}
\subsubsection{The garden}
They find this suck, twisted, evil garden. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{The Promised Future Aeons}{
  The faces you saw in the withering garden.\\
  I witnessed the flickering, made to look like stone.\\
  Quivering like little figures lost in broken flames.\\
  Never to forget again the names carved in horrid flesh.
}





\subsubsection{They find \Semiza}
\target{Explorers meet Semiza}
Following the trail they stumbled upon in the garden, they somehow found the \hr{Semiza entombed}{tomb} of \hr{Semiza}{\Semiza}. 

\citebandsong{Nile:InTheirDarkenesShrines}{Nile}{

  By This Vast Array of the Dead
}



He beckoned them to him. 

\Semiza{} had been able to listen to the \resphain{} telepathically, so he understood their tongue well enough to make himself understood. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Sanctity In Blasphemous Ruin}{
  Welcome to my dwellings of unholiness. \\
  Upheld, the blackest dreams, oh, infernal bliss. \\
  Your tabernacles pleasured and continuance \\
  lies in the innocents existence. 
  
  Down through the bowels of unholiness. \\
  Upheld, the blackest deeds, oh, infernal bliss. \\
  I am he who is malevolence, \\
  raping the weary so diminished. \\
  Come, mighty Babalon, \\
  mother of Abominations. \\
  Grant me the flesh, grant me the fear, \\
  grant me sanctity of ruin. 
}

They communicated with \Semiza. 
They felt his wisdom and \hr{Madness}{madness} like a palpable force. 

He showed them visions and revelations. 
He told them that everything they believed was a lie. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Grotesquery Conceiled Within Measureless Magic}{
  Poor misguided fool\ldots{}\\
  It is not God you are talking to.\\
  I am not impostrous, hiding behind perly walls.\\
  However, I am still yet to be found, known.\\
  I shall guide you on your midnight-ride as the sun fades black.\\
  And beyond your grotesque imagination,\\
  my name will be revealed\ldots{} \\
  The blood of Christ can't heal your wounds.\
  Give me all of yours, and I'll give you mine\ldots{}
}

Terrible images from his own time, of death, ruin and the fall of his kingdom. 
And memories of \Erebos{} and the \banes. 

\lyricslimbonicart{Seven Doors of Death}{
  Woe be unto him who ventures near.\\
  without knowledge.\\
  Ultra violent scenarios.\\
  Anguish crying.\\
  Images from the beyond.\\
  Nightmares never dying.

  Psychological terror, permanent psychosis.\\
  A sculpture in the land of decay.\\
  Woe be unto him who opens\\
  the seven dreaded gateways.
  
  Asylum of neurotic minds.\\
  Devour all consciousness.\\
  Insanity is there to find.\\
  Dominion of darkness.
}

He tells them about their origins, how they were created by the dreadful \banes. 
He awakens their memories, repressed and buried deep down in their minds.

\lyricslimbonicart{Seven Doors of Death}{
  Walk and dream amongst the dead.\\
  Anger and pain resurrected.\\
  Necropolis manifestation.\\
  Supernatural obsession.\\
  Phantasmagorical state of mind.\\
  Trapped in another dimension of time.\\
  In a paradise lost.\\
  Endless horizon of wilderness and holocaust.
}

Now, the \resphain{} did have vague, mostly repressed memories of having once had connections to the \banes{} in their infant past. 
They did not know the \pps{\banes}{} identity, but they could recognize the feeling of them. 
(Do all \resphain{} have this memory through \hr{Resphan racial memory}{some kind of racial memory}, or is it only the oldest generations that remember it?) 
Some of them tried to deny \ps{\Semiza}{} tale, but others could not deny that it not only rang true, but also suddenly made a lot of pieces of the puzzle of their repressed memory and past come together.

Perhaps they get their hands on \ps{\Semiza}{} \hr{Book of Erebos}{\BookofErebos}. 

They learn that they are created by the \banes{} to carry on their culture and soul, the very legacy of \Erebos. 
And they learn of the dark greatness that is rightly theirs. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Societe des Luciferiens}{
  In the midst of Our black paradise \\
  shall undefiled wisdom rule. \\
  The rites of Christ are but rites of Death, \\
  now receive the truth.
}





\subsubsection{\Semiza{} shows them tailored visions}
\target{Semiza shows tailored visions}
Perhaps \Semiza{} reads each of their minds and shows each of them a personally tailored vision that is meant to shape their life. 
Remember, \Semiza{} is a genius. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    Ramiel was shown \hr{Ramiel is nothing}{his own insignificance}. 
  \item 
    \Shiaraid{} was taught \hr{Shiaraid develops sadomasochism}{that she was really a sadomasochist}. 
\end{enumerate}



\lyricsbs{Hate Eternal}{Behold Judas}{
  I bestow upon you my contempt, Master of the Arcane.\\
  I bestow upon you apathy, Master of the Labyrinth.\\
  I bestow upon you malice, Master of the Kingdom.\\
  I bestow upon you savagery, Master of the Revered Palace.
}









\subsection{Their reaction to the truth}
Some of them are dismayed by this and feel reinforced in their principles of sin, shame and atonement. 
After all, this confirms that their myths are true: 
They were created by evil and have evil in their blood, and they must strictly discipline themselves to suppress and overcome this. 

But others feel liberated: 
They have no sin within them. 
The darkness, the \quo{evil} they feel is their true nature and purpose. 
It is not something wrong and bad, something to reject and suppress. 
Rather, it is their true selves and should be embraced. 
They feel an immense freedom. 
Suddenly they need no longer feel guilt and shame; they can embrace their inner selves, for this is what they were created to be. 

Some of them grow to hate \Merkyrah. 

\lyricsbs{Hate Eternal}{Beyond Redemption}{
  In vein of sacred scriptures\\
  provide the sight and visions.\\
  The lusting of hypocrisy\\
  forever scars the soul.\\
  Cursed is the life once given.\\
  Your prayers obsolite.\\
  The termination of the myths\\
  you've led yourself to believe.
}









\subsection{The first schism}
Already out there on the expedition, a schism forms between two factions: 
Those who wish to embrace their newfound dark past and those who wish to fight against it. 
They argue a lot while they're out there, and more on the way back. 

Some of the \quo{dark siders} decide that they will reach no consensus, and that the \quo{light siders} are a threat to them. 
Reasonably enough; the light siders would likely report them to the church and have all the dark siders tortured and killed. 

So the dark siders, or at least some of them, conspire and kill the light siders. 
They disguise it as an accident. 

There are also some neutrals, or some wimpy dark siders, who were too afraid to take part in the murder. 
These are now forced to side with the other dark siders and help keep the secret, or they too will be tortured and killed by the authorities for letting it happen. 
(Remember, the \resphan{} church is not reasonable. 
It will punish people harshly at the drop of a hat, and assume suspects to be guilty until proven innocent.)

Perhaps some \quo{light siders} die of the shock, or kill themselves. 
Perhaps some wimpy neutrals lose the will to live and waste away. 
Unable to handle the truth. 









\subsection{They try to repress it}
The explorers try to repress this new knowledge of theirs, but it keeps coming back to them and will not leave them alone. 
Day and night it haunts them, and they dream and ponder it. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{The Promised Future Aeons}{
  Burn the pictures, so unexpected in this strange deserted place.\\
  Once opened its secrets would become the world.\\
  Its attributes would continue to unfold forever.
  
  Through the fabric of the promised future aeons.\\
  I offer this suffering of my unwanted father\ldots{}
  
  And the stars did wander,\\
  separated in the forbidden Universe. 
}

\citebandsong{DeathspellOmega:SiMonumentumRequiresCircumspice}{%

  They burst my veins to pieces, these wan rats inside,\\
  with their jaws so contagious of a disease,\\
  as if it dropped like pus from the twelve wings of Sammael.\\
  The primeval light inside, gift of god and the holy spirit.\\
  It bleeds, so swollen by the bubo of this pest divine.\\
  The least traces of the consolation of Eden\\
  were consumed by this heinous blessing in ashes.
}

They try to carry on their lives as normal, but they can't. 
So they start their underground movement. 









\subsection{One comes to term with it}
One of the rebels battles with the revelations and tries to come to terms with it. 
It might be \Shiaraid, or \Sithiyacaan, or even \Damiarch. 
Let's assume for the nonce that it's \Shiaraid. 

She fears to give up \Merkyrah{} and the things she likes about it. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{With Strength I Burn}{
  Deep Green Dark Chaos.\\
  Blinded I run down these paths.\\
  By heart I know them.\\
  They lead to the soaring cliffs.\\
  Stout they stand above the water's edge,\\
  lifeless.
  
  And this is my foundation:\\
  Cold stone.\\
  Formed only by winds and time.\\
  How invulnerable,\\
  lifeless.
}

She wonders if \ps{\Semiza}{} revelations can really be true. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{With Strength I Burn}{
  For once I wish to see\\
  the entity behind the voice.\\
  The face of this seduction,\\
  the beauty of my pain.
  
  Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?\\
  What is my crime, what is my deed?\\
  Is this life my redemption?\\
  Shall I repent or proceed?
}

She chooses side and pledges herself to the rebellion. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{With Strength I Burn}{
  I hate my flesh.\\
  Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt.\\
  It made me question\\
  the essence of the \quo{I}.\\
  Slaves are those of this world\\
  given freedom to lay chains upon The Master.
  
  The wolf is no longer free.\\
  Release the chains and come for me.
}

She is fascinated by the opportunities this revolution offers. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{With Strength I Burn}{
  Grant me sight so I can see\\
  that which lies ahead of me.\\
  Cursed be my mortal eyes\\
  for dying in the realm of Death.
}

After the whole rebellion and conquest is concluded, she ponders whether it was worth the cost. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{With Strength I Burn}{
  I return to the soaring cliffs.\\
  They truly shine of strength.\\
  Even though I nothing learned.\\
  With strength I burn\ldots{}
}









\subsection{They feel their new power}
The dark ones discover a tremendous power when they embrace \nieur. A destructive and creative force. They cannot fully channel and control it yet, but they can feel the immensity of it. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Awakening of the Stars}{
  With but a gesture of my incorporeal hand 
  I illumine the heart of a new-born sun,
  revelling as its searing stellar radiance engulfs my ersatz form.
  Gazing out across the limitless, stygian cosmos,
  I hear the whispered voice of destiny echoing within the solar winds\ldots{}
  
  No small task, to awaken a universe from slumber.}

This feeling is further magnified \hr{Origin of Satharioth}{when they become \satharioth}. 

\lyricslimbonicart{A Cosmic Funeral of Memories}{
  The night belongs to the predator\\
  to the one who dares crossing the threshold,\\
  the axis of dreams and wonders and black miracles.\\
  I see my self in the mirror of your eyes:\\
  A dark star on the celestial beautiful midnight sky.\\
  Release the inner radiance of what you have become.\\
  Brighten the night with your sacrifice.
  
  I have returned to life to speak of clairvoyance.\\
  I am the voice from the grave land of memories.\\
  Life can be only an illusion, and death a temptation,\\
  a final destiny.
}

\lyricsbs{Arcane Wisdom}{Of Skyfire Burning Deep}{
  In dark waters shall we bathe \\
  yet again, as we`d done aeons ago. \\
  Wretched souls left grimly wandering \\
  like specters of a long-dead kingdom. \\
  And so great and mighty, the dismal sky \\
  whither we shall return to \\
  when the day arrives.
}

\lyricsbs{Aeternus}{Burning the Shroud}{
  Within you it lies since the rise of your time.\\
  You've feared it, ignored, but truth never lies.\\
  Its existence marked at the birth of time.\\
  The darkness inside.\\
  The shadows that dance in your soul.
  
  To deny is to fear.\\
  Embrace the darkness.\\
  Reveal in its power.\\
  Within it lies the harmonious truth.\\
  A voyage into the cave of shadows\\
  yields the jewels of knowledge and wisdom.
  
  Does not the night\\
  and the silver moon\\
  enchant your being?
  
  The caressing whisper of the night.\\
  No harm will come to those who are true of heart.\\
  Look to the sun and the brightness shall blind you.\\
  Stare into the black embrace,\\
  the sight deepened with wisdom.
  
  Free your consciousness.\\
  Accept the reality of darkness.\\
  It has never been a place of dread.\\
  Knowledge and wisdom\\
  is given to those who seek.
  Achieve the empowerment\\
  of endless mysterious nights.
}









\subsection[{Ramiel, Shiaraid and Eryal}]{Ramiel, \Shiaraid and \Eryal}
From \Semiza, Ramiel had learned sadism and \Shiaraid{} had learned masochism. 
They quickly implemented this in practice in their sex life. 
They loved it. 
They found great pleasure in this \quo{sinful} behaviour. 

But \Shiaraid{} found out that she was not entirely content. 
She had both dominant and submissive lusts. 
She wanted to take turns being the dominant part. 
Ramiel would have none of that. 
Already he had developed an irrational fear of being \quo{nothing}. 
Being sexually submissive would confirm that fear. 
He would not let that happen. 
He would prove to himself that he was not nothing, that he was superior and not inferior. 
So he refused to submit to anyone, even the \resvil{} he loved. 

\Shiaraid{} was nonplussed. 
She tried to persuade or tempt him, but it became clear he would not budge. 
She was unhappy for a while, but then she realized that their new rebellious philosophy had no rules about monogamy. 
If she wanted a kind of sex that her lover was not providing, she was free to go elsewhere and get it. 

So \Shiaraid{} went out looking for a lover. 
She found \Eryal. 
They had known each other a little bit before and had been attracted to each other, but lesbianism was forbidden in \Merkyrah, so they had repressed their feelings. 
Now \Shiaraid{} sought out \Eryal{}.
She could tell that \Eryal{} had submissive tendencies. 
Her new realization of her own hidden lusts had also given her clearer sight when it came to reading other \resphain{} and \emph{their} repressed feelings and desires. 

\Eryal{} knew nothing of the rebellion and was a demure and faithful \Merkyran. 
But she was attracted to \Shiaraid, and \Shiaraid, having already partially embraced her dark nature, suddenly shone with a new aura of glory, beauty, promise and forbidden allure. 
\Shiaraid{} did her best to seduce \Eryal, and the young, inexperienced \Eryal{} could not resist her. 
They had sex. 
And their sex quickly become dark and naughty. 
\Eryal{} loved being dominated and gave in one hundred percent. 
Soon she was virtually \ps{\Shiaraid} slave, in the bedroom and out of it. 
She lived to serve and obey her mistress, and she loved her. 





\subsubsection{Ramiel's hypocrisy}
Ramiel picked up on the fact that \Shiaraid{} had an affair with \Eryal. 
He was not happy that \Shiaraid{} was having sex with other people.
Worse, he sensed that she had a \emph{better} relationship with \Eryal{} than with him. 
\Eryal{} submitted to \Shiaraid{} more whole-heartedly and sincerely than \Shiaraid{} ever submitted to Ramiel. 
He became jealous. 

So he called \Shiaraid{} out on it. 
She explained her reasoning as if it were the most natural thing in the world: 
They had rejected the \Merkyran{} religion and were free to have sex with whomever they chose. 
\ta{Is it not wonderful, Ramiel? I love it, this new freedom.}

Ramiel could not argue with that, but it did not sit well with him. 
He knew he was being a hypocrite, but he was not happy about having to share his \resvil{} with others. 
Like all \resphain, he had \hr{Resphain are possessive}{a genetic urge to own his \resvil}. 
He had grown up with the strict monogamous tradition of \Merkyrah. 
From childhood he had learned that it was his goal in life (like every other \resphan) to strive to possess a \resvil{} and make her his own. 

\Shiaraid{} had abandoned monogamy, so Ramiel did likewise. 
He went out and had sex with other \resviel. 
By the time this happened, he was a popular rebel leader and could attract a fair number of groupies. 
So he fucked them. 
And he was rough with them. 
Some of them he hurt really badly. 
He was a sexual sadist now, remember? 

But it did not make him happy. 
He still had sex with \Shiaraid, but he knew he had to share her with others, and that made him bitter. 
He wanted to own \Shiaraid. 
He began to hate \Eryal. 

\Shiaraid{} noticed that Ramiel was not hitting it off with \Eryal. 
She encouraged the two to have sex, hoping that it would bring them closer together. 
\Eryal, eager to please her mistress' every whim, went to Ramiel and offered herself to him. 
She submitted to him and let him dominate her to his heart's desire. 
He did. 
\emph{Brutally}.

\Eryal{} halfway regretted having agreed to do it. 
When \Shiaraid{} tortured her, it was always with an undertone of love. 
Not so with Ramiel. 
He \emph{genuinely} wanted her to suffer. 
And suffer she did. 
\Eryal{} begged and whimpered and cried and wept. 

And it did not help much.
Their relationship did not really improve. 





\subsubsection{\Eryal{} joins the rebellion}
\Eryal{} joined the rebellion. 
She was urged to do so by \Shiaraid. 

\Eryal{} was good and faithful and did not like the evil she saw in the rebels. 

\citebandsong{BeyondTwilight:FortheLoveofArtandtheMaking%

}{
  As night turns into morning\\
  All the shadows disappear\\
  Although mine is still here
  
  As morning turns into night\\
  All the shadows reappear\\
  Although mine is not here?
}

But she knew she dearly loved \Shiaraid, and she dearly loved the sex she had. 
\Merkyrah{} would forbid their relationship. 
And if she refused to join, she and \Shiaraid{} would be torn apart on either sides of the war. 
She could not live with being parted from her mistress. 

Besides, (\Shiaraid{} argued,) there were several great and wise people on the rebels' side. 
Surely they could not be all wrong\ldots{}

So, despite her misgivings, \Eryal{} gave herself to the rebellion. 

Be sure to depict how happy \Eryal{} was when \Shiaraid{} approved of her decision to join the rebels. 
She beamed under her beloved mistress' affection and compliments. 

\Eryal{} was introduced to \Semiza. 
She was scared of him. 

She joined, but she still feared it was madness.

\target{Rebels lose Semiza}
In the beginning, \Semiza fulfilled the role of an oracle. 
He told \Damiarch-tachi things about the vast, dark universe and their own origins and their place in it.

Later, the rebels somehow lost contact with \Semiza. 
Perhaps the \Merkyrans{} discover a sense of evil emanating from his twisted garden, and so they bomb the place and seal it up. 
Comparable to how the authorities bombard Innsmouth and Devil's Reef in \authorbook{\HPLovecraft}{The Shadow Over Innsmouth} and the game \emph{Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth}. 

So from here on they are on their own and without his guidance. 
They must discover their true selves by experimentation. 
They slowly begin to split into various ideological factions (later becoming the dynasties that would later \hr{Dynasties drift apart}{drift apart}). 
Some believe that only through utter depravity will they discover/realize their true nature and destiny. 
Others believe that they must master their inner darkness/evil and bring it under control via some kind of morality (these become \CiriathSepher). 















\section{Darkness Festers}
\subsection{Underground cult}
The enlightened ones know that they cannot simply cry their newfound knowledge from the rooftops. They would be killed. But they can gather supporters from among the \hr{Early fallen Resphain}{fallen ones}. 

So they form an underground cult, a rebel organization, and begin gathering strength, politically and mystically, by doing research and learning to control their true power, unfiltered by the false Light. 

Some of the fallen ones are overjoyed. Suddenly they discover that they are not just weaklings after all; they were simply living out their true nature all along. They need no longer feel shame and self-hatred. And what's even better, they can use their darkness to overthrow the government, get revenge on the church that has hated and oppressed them for so long, and gain power, glory and eternal, sinful pleasure. Suddenly their bleak, failed existence has a purpose. 

The enlightened ones were mighty and capable \resphain{} already before they went on their expedition, and they are even mightier now that they have learned to channel their true power (to some limited extent). The fallen ones are wimps, so they embrace the enlightened ones as their saviours and bow down to worship at their feet. Ramiel suddenly finds himself with several \resviel{} (hot goth chicks) begging to be his sex slaves, pleading for the opportunity to give him pleasure\dash and then doing their utmost to please him. This is an awesome feeling for Ramiel, because \resphain{} lust very much after the \resviel, who are fewer in number and sexually picky. (They lust after \human{} women, too, but much more so after \resviel. The \resviel{} are far more attractive because they possess better genes and will produce \resphan{} offspring.)

\lyricsdimmuborgir{The Blazing Monoliths of Defiance}{
  Godless temples beckon,\\
  through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare.\\
  Gathered between symbols and signs.\\
  A glow of new light is born out of the night.
}

They grow to hate \Merkyrah{} and feel are disgusted by its supposed marvels. 
Some succumb to nihilism and begin to hate everything. 

\lyricsbs{Arcane Wisdom}{Misanthropic Horror Magnified}{
  Senseless oblivious towers,\\
  monuments to absurdity.\\
  Oceans of ignorance.\\
  Humanity at its cruel best!

  Misanthropic horror\ldots{} magnified.
  
  Decadence is all I see. \\
  Triviality lies before me. \\
  Nihilism\dash the only solution. \\
  Misanthropy\dash the final escapism. 
  
  Your world sinks to vomiting proportions. \\
  Visions of decay spring everywhere. \\
  Entire lost civilizations \\
  succumb to a \quo{worldly} oddity. 
  
  Woe and torment be behind me\ldots{} \\
  the maze of such reality. 
}





\subsubsection{A counter-cult existed}
Before the Delving there already existed one or more subcultures in \Merkyrah that rebelled against the system and the religion. 
They idolized everything that was opposite to the prevailing system. 

Compare to how some Satanists use the inverted cross as their symbol. 

\citeauthorbook[p.111]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  The malevolent octopoid shape, eldritch green and seething\ldots{} suggests a tower of devils ululating, thirsting, slaying and yammering.
  Dread Cthulhu who begins to Awaken, I leave you refreshed.
  The color of your embryonic shadow grants me foul nourishment.
  Sacrificial blood is the water of life. 
  A million tributes to Satan, Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, Hastur, Tsathoggua, Tsalal, and Satanis.}
  
The rebels easily assimilated these counter-cultists. 

It is worth mentioning that the \resphan rebels, for all their rebellion, still preached submission and obedience to the gods, unlike \Sethicus, who preached dominance and freedom and personal will and personal power. 

\citeauthorbook[p.113--114]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  I AM here, horned, slimy, gruesome and unholy Masters.
  The demons of the ancient chasm share my soul\dash viscous green and dripping from Cthulhu's tentacled mind.
  So incomprehensible is our Drowned Lord, so unclean His presence, so dark and contemplative is his manner. 
  
  One thousand gateways opening into the Great Singular Void. 
  
  As I see this universal model, I shall know its weakness and limitations.
  I AM stronger than this world.
  By the foul, corpulent stench of the Elder Things I travel through the astral dimensions.
  Passing by alien caverns, purple skies, and sunken cities I journey to the end of time\ldots{} before the universe was born.
  Where the Old Ones rule.
  Their crimson thrones like a gluttonous abbatoir.

  Give me aid, Powers of Darkness!
  I beseech you; grant me strength to annihilate this false paradigm.
  We are not the masters\ldots{} killing and reveling.
  In your loathsome name, I spread the wisdom as tentacles erupt from the forbidden subterranean doorways. 
}





\subsubsection{An army of misfits}
The rebels end up with a terrible army of misfits, madmen, malcontents, criminals, heretics and outcasts. 
The good leaders are not entirely happy about this. 
But the evil ones (\Zachirah, \Gevural) enjoy it and do their best to fully utilize and channel the evil potential. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Master of the Bryansk Forest}{
  Waffen-Sturm-Brigade RONA, \\
  filled up with criminal prison inmates, \\
  political prisoners, traitors and faggots \\
  to defend the newborn Republic of Lokot. \\

  a murderous phenomenon behind enemy lines. \\
  Anti-Soviet, pro-German death squads \\
  ambushed in the woods of Bryansk.
  
  Partisan liers-in-wait, \\
  dressed in bloodstained White Army uniforms. \\
  Anti-Soviet, pro-German Werewolves \\
  assembled before the gates of Warsaw. \\
  Warsaw's Jews, Gypsies and retards, \\
  prepare yourself for death and horror. \\
  The Kaminski Brigade enters the perimeter \\
  and waits for the command to lay your city in ruins.
}

They wage a secret guerilla war. 

\lyricsbs{Hate Eternal}{The Obscure Terror}{
  We are your enemies, sworn to secrecy.\\
  Mentors of all that is profane.\\
  We are betrayers, devoid of your worth.\\
  We thrive in all that is stained.\\

  Why hinder thou from escaping obscurity,\\

  We flourish in your pain.\\
  In your blindness, your very blindness,\\
  we attack with ferocity.
  
  Strength through adversity.\\
  Death with nobility.\\
  Instruments of insurgency.\\
  We are the obscure terror.
}

\Kezrabal-tachi emphasize that angry misfits have an important part to play in the world, especially in the conflict that is to come.

}





\subsubsection{Awakening their inner darkness}
The rebels perform occult rituals in an attempt to contact and awaken the true darkness within them. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Scrolls of a Millenium Past}{
  Arose from the second triangle burning my soul. \\
  Gehenna is the place for burning, takes me away. \\
  Order of the golden dawn summoning Beelzebub. \\
  Give your eternal loyalty, demon of death and evil.

  and (the) creator of all living things. \\
  Even the gods bow at my feet \\
  to lick the blood from my sword.
  
  Book of Revelations. I forsee the fallen angels \\
  rise to destroy the ministers of God. \\
  Strong as a lion in the Moon of the woods. \\

}

They discover great, mystic, Chaotic pleasure. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Into Cold Darkness}{
  Sensual pleasures of non-resistant triumph.\\
  Spiritual tendencies deeply rooted in man's psyche.\\
  Ab-I-Hayat, waters of immortality,\\
  a sanctuary to mortuate your mind.

\subsection[Sithiyacan and his idealism]{\Sithiyacaan{} and his idealism}
\Sithiyacaan{} was one of the original \hr{Resphan rebels}{\resphan{} rebels}. He was idealistic, driven by a sincere dream to bring freedom and enlightenment to the \resphan{} people. He disliked the totalitarian and repressive \Merkyran{} church and wanted to give the people a better, happier alternative. He had scruples, but was seduced by the darkness and the leaders of the rebels (such as \hr{Gepheral}{\Gevural} and his brother). 

He believes that the \Merkyran{} religion will lead to a slow death of stagnation. 
He believes that one must first destroy in order to pave the way for new creation. 
He believes that breaking the rules is the way to creation, insight, happiness and a way out of slavery, stagnation, stupidity and prejudice.

He becomes a Zarathustra-like preacher. Compare to \authorbook{Friedrich Nietzsche}{Also Sprach Zarathustra}. 

Most people, \resphan{} and mortal alike, do not understand the rebels. They mock them and laugh at them. The rebels become more bitter, and even the more idealistic ones, like \Sithiyacaan, begin to accept that more extreme methods are needed. 









\subsection{The Glory of Darkness}
The \Merkyrans{} denied their \hr{Resphan vampirism}{vampiric nature}. This made them weak, declining as the years and generations passed. So at this point, thousands of years after the initial creation of the \resphain, they were mere shadows of themselves.

The rebels realized that they were the \quo{children of \nieur}, which in turn was born of Chaos and Darkness. 

As the rebels learn more of their true power, they start draining life again. First they drink a bit of blood. Some of them drink each other's blood during sex. This is hot and gives them pleasure, but it doesn't help, since they're just draining each other. Then they start draining the blood of others, and eating \human{} flesh. They get a taste for it, and their perverse tastes escalate into orgies. Eventually, they dare abduct and kill \resphain{}, drink their blood and eat their flesh. Even later, they learn to drain all a person's lifeforce and suck out and devour his soul. 

The more they do this\dash and other dark things\dash the more they revert to their true nature. And it shows. The darkness inside them seems to glow even stronger than light. They are respendent in their dark majesty and glory, and they awaken even more of their natural ability to command \humans{} (and, to a lesser extent, other creatures such as \nephilim). 

Their cult grows dramatically. Especially \humans{} flock to them, for even though the rebels are clearly evil, their charm and authority is so great that the feeble \humans{} (who are, after all, created with the chief purpose of being slaves of the \resphain, not question their morality) can't help but admire and worship them. They are the first \emph{true} \resphain{} that these \humans{} have met, and they are overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness. 

The \hs{Voices of God} contacted the dark ones in visions and tried to stop them. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Empyreal Lexicon}{
  Such carnage wrought with your malevolent tongue, dark one\ldots{}\\
  What unfathomable horrors dwell within the lightless corners of your cursed soul?\\
  Heed not the voice of the Lexicon\ldots{} lest its whispers drive you mad!}

The \resphain learned that they were created by dark, formless, hideous gods in order to help them break free and eventually inherit their legacy.
This was a horrible realization.
New cultists who were admitted into the inner circle and told the inner mysteries often went through three stages of insight. 

\citeauthorbook[p.92--93]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  \ldots I have discovered three separate stages of AWakening. 
  Without knowing about these states, an initiate might very easily lose his way. 
  
  I have talked with Cultists who practiced self-remembering only to find themselves stripped bare, devoid of feeling or emotion.
  A vast emptiness consumed them, and they were left with sensations of cold, terrifying clarity.
  While disorienting, Cultists should not be alarmed after experiencing this first stage of Awakening 
  
  After this initial feeling of nothingness, comes a calm joyfulness.
  Entering this second state allows a Cultist to build energy, discipline, and understanding. 
  The second state comes after the Cultist has become familiar with the unconfortable and distressing first state of Awakening. 
  
  The third state of Awakening is the payoff, the most exciting part.
  This state of being utilizes directed, conscious force.
  The Cultist creates goals and then uses his Awakened consciousness to achieve them. 
  
  To recap: the first is nothingness, second is understanding, and the third is creating.
  
  These are the three states of Awakening.
  If you've only encountered the first state, then it's no wonder that it feels strange and possibly even horrible.
  Keep trying to consciously exist in the present moment and eventually you will reach the second stage.
  Finally, after months of training, the most rewarding state will unfold.
  Reality will obey you rather than the other way around.
}

They preach that the true religion shall come to rule. 

\citeauthorbook[p.100--101]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  One night, an unearthly squid will erupt from an emerald green trapezoid, and this shall be the symbol of Cthulhu's Cult. 
  Three tentacles will comprise the governing bodies: magic, religion, and philosophy.
  Thus a new age of darkness is born; an old age of darkness returns.
  Exalted are the beasts who understand what can never be seen!
  
  \ldots
  
  Black magic is the new law; ritual chambers shall become our courtroom.
  With such undreamt of power, the Cult of Cthulhu shall uphold the Will of the Ancient Ones because Their Will is congruent with mankind's evolution!
  And when They emerge from their shimmering, luminous rifts in time and space, our organization will be there to usher in the change. 
}





\subsubsection{\Kezrabal, the propaganda minister}
\target{Kezrabal becomes propaganda minister}
\index{propaganda minister}
One of the rebels, \Kezrabal, was the \quo{propaganda minister}. 
He wa the most talented demagogue of them and pulled lots of people in. 
He told them whatever they want to hear, whatever they \emph{needed} to hear, and was perfectly willing to tell outright lies if it was convenient. 

He preached of the glory of the rebellion. 

\lyricsbs{Exmortem}{The Revolutionary Soul}{

\subsubsection{New people are lured in}
The rebellion lures in new people, folks who are disgruntled with the church. 

The more evil sub-fractions preach hate and revenge, whereas the more idealistic fractions preach truth and freedom. 
\Gevural{} was pretty brutal at first, but got much more refined when he became \Azraid. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Broderskapets Ring}{

New members are initiated in a ritual where they die, get in contact with the \Erebean{} force of Entropy and are symbolically reborn as new, purer, better \resphain. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Master of Disharmony}{

\subsubsection{Outcasts embrace the rebellion}
Especially outcasts\dash such as the \ashenblooded\dash embrace the rebellion. 
After they win, the \ashenblooded{} are still rewarded with nothing but scorn, however.

\subsubsection{They prove that their religion is stronger}
Have some biblical scenes where the rebels prove that their religion and their magic is stronger than that of \Merkyrah. 
Compare to the scene in Exodus (Old Testament) where the Egyptian sorcerers turn their staves into snakes. 









\subsection{Learning how to command \umbrae}
\target{Resphain learn to command Umbrae}
The \Merkyrans{} had always lived \hr{Merkyrans fear Umbrae}{in fear of the dangerous \umbrae}. 
\Semiza{} taught the rebels how to ward off the \umbrae, or even command them. 
This became one of their greatest weapons in the war, physically as well as psychologically. 
Many took this conquest of their ancestral foes as meaning one of two things: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    The rebels had the right idea. 
    They knew how to combat the decline and depredations they had been suffering from. 
    Theirs was the way to power, glory and advancement for the \resphan{} people. 
  \item 
    The rebels were evil itself. 
\end{enumerate}

\target{Rebels awestruck by tame Umbrae}
The lower-ranking rebels were awestruck when they for the first time saw their masters come riding on on subdued \umbrae. 
(\Achsah{} was one of them, as \hr{Achsah fetches Umbrae}{she would later recall}.)









\subsection{Learning how to kill a \resphan}
Previously, no one knew how to kill a \resphan, so they would never die. 
The very oldest \resphain{} ever were still alive at this point. 

But the rebels learned how to permanently destroy a \resphan. 
Maybe \Semiza{} told them. 
They must kill the body, cook it with special spells, eat the victim's flesh, drink his blood and devour his soul. 

\target{Rebels learn soul-eating from Umbrae}
They learned this skill by studying the \hr{Umbra}{\umbrae} and sort of reverse-engineering the \ps{\umbrae} \hr{Umbrae eat souls}{soul-eating technique}. 
But they never learned to do it as easily and effectively as the \umbrae{}. 

This was a horrible, gruesome weapon, and the \Merkyrans{} were horrified when they learned of it. 









\subsection{The \resphan{} lords betray their own}
There are cases where the \resphan{} lords betray their own and eat them. 
The leaders eat their younger fans, adherents, groupies, worshippers\dash those who trusted and loved them. 

Compare to Akasha in the movie \emph{Queen of the Damned}. 









\subsection{Show the good side of \Merkyrah}
\Semiza{} and the rebels dissed \Merkyrah{} like no tomorrow. 
But we should still see some scenes demonstrating the good sides of \Merkyrah. 

Show people who were happy about their lives. 
Have some tree-hugging, diabetes-inducing sweetness and gay pacifism. 









\subsection{The rebellion is necessary}
\target{Merkyran rebellion is necessary}
The rebels know that the rebellion, no matter how brutal, is necessary. 
The \resphan{} people are not only far from their true potential, they are actively declining. 
If they continue the \Merkyran{} way, they will continue to degenerate until they are no more powerful than \humans. 
In the end their Entropic hunger will consume them and they will die. 
Being afflicted with \Bane{} \hs{Entropy}, the \hr{Resphan parasitism}{\resphain{} are parasitic} and must consume external power to survive. 

They must gain access to the \hr{Heart}{Heart of \Miith} and draw of its power. 
This is the only way to keep their people alive. 
But the \dragons{} and their ilk are hogging the Heart. 
In order to eat of the Heart's power, they must steal it from the \dragons. 
So war is the only option. 

The rebels cannot hope to stand against the \dragons{} alone. 
They can stand a chance only if the entire \resphan{} people stands united. 
They know that the \Merkyran{} church will never accept this truth, since their entire religion is knowingly and deliberately build up around the active denial of this very truth. 
Thus, a violent rebellion and coup is the only way. 

The more moral rebels (especially \Damiarch{} and \Sithiyacaan) are saddened by this, but they have a sacred duty to their people and must do what they must. 
Their entire race's survival and future is at stake. 
That is more important than anything, and worth any price, even genocide and tyranny.

He also founded \hr{Mystraacht philosophy}{\ps{\Mystraacht}{} evil philosophy} (see that section). 

He preached hate and violence. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Progenies of the Great Apocalypse}{
  The battle raged on and on, \\
  fuelled by the venom of hatred for Man. \\
  Consistently, without the eyes to see, \\
  by those who revel in sewer equally.

  fearing all the mediocrity that they possess? \\
  Should we not hunt the bastards down with our might, \\
  reinforce and claim the throne that is rightfully ours?
  
  Consider the god we could be without the grace. \\
  Once and for all. \\
  Diminish the sub principle and leave it's toxic trace. \\
  Once and for all.
}

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Vredesbyrd}{

He recruited new people to join his faction. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{I Am God}{

They feel that this new truth they have discovered not only warrants but \emph{demands} a total break from tradition.

\subsection{Rebels ally with tribes}
The rebels allied with some of the other \resphan{} tribes that were the traditional enemies of \Merkyrah. 
\Zachirah \hr{Zachirah has tribe contacts}{had contacts among the tribes}, so he was central in establishing this alliance. 

Compare to how Alexander Devon recruits the Heshette in \authorbook{Alan Campbell}{Scar Night}.

\subsubsection{Alliance with freed prisoners}
At \Zachirah's initiative, the rebels freed some prisoners from the \hr{Merkyrah prison}{dungeons of \Merkyrah}, if these agreed to serve them and join the rebellion and help overthrow \Merkyrah. 









\subsection{A rebel kills a faithful}
A rebel gets into a fight and kills a faithful. 
This is one of the sparks that ignite open war. 

The killer had been nurturing hate towards the church and the faithful for a long time, and finally snapped, craving release.

\section{The Mask Falls (\yds{Murder of the Dawn})}
\subsection{Rebellion}
\target{Merkyran rebellion}
\target{Resphan rebellion}
It comes to open rebellion and war between the dark siders and the light siders. 

Since the \Merkyrans{} deny their vampiric nature, they are weak, easy prey for the rebels, who strike them down and devour their blood, flesh and their very souls. Remember to have some dark, grisly scenes where the rebels eat \resphan{} flesh. 

The dark ones announce their war by launching a grand attack on a \Merkyran{} city. They fall upon it like a terrible storm. 

Have some bloodbath scenes where \Merkyrans{} and their \human{} and \nephilic{} subjects are mowed down in droves. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Thirteen Cryptical Prophecies of Mu}{
  [THE CHIEF CULTIST OF ZURRA:]\\
  In the sweltering swathe of Zurra's sword! Kill, kill, kill! \\

  The storm comes.\\
  On the katabatic winds rides ravening doom.\\
  Yasa-mega\ldots{} Yasa-giga\ldots{} Yasa-tera!\\
  May Klatrymadon preserve us!
}

Perhaps there are some \nexus{} \trope{McGuffin}{McGuffins} in the city that the dark ones need. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Thirteen Cryptical Prophecies of Mu}{
  Become one with the shard, progeny of the Nexus\ldots{}\\

}

They fight with pride, considering themselves the true keepers of their race's legacy. 

\lyricsbs{Ancient Rites}{Victory or Valhalla (Last Man Standing)}{
  Stand strong with clenched fists. \\
  Withstand with all thy might. \\
  Stand strong with clenched fists \\

The \Merkyrans{} fight back.

  Now face the true potency of the power you seek to destroy, and behold in awe the true nature of the universe!}





\subsubsection{Demography of the war}
\index{technology!\Merkyrah}
There were \hr{Merkyran demography}{rather many \resphain{} at this time}, and \hr{Merkyran technology}{the technology was low}. 
This meant that armies of mortals little chance against \resphain. 
So the war was fought largely with armies of \resphain. 
They rode mythical beasts and monsters. 

Many great, beautiful and wonderful monuments are destroyed in the war. 
\Azraid{} and Ramiel promise the people that they will built new ones, and even grander and more marvelous. 
They do, but many of these then end up getting destroyed in the \secondbanewar{} and the \resphanwars. 

But even today the \resphain{} have much splendour and beauty. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Into Cold Darkness}{
  Now hundreds of angels rebel against God. \\
  Winged and naked, riding black wolves.
}

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Descent Into Hell}{
  Riding out the demon locust, war horses of Hell. \\
  Penetrating the blazing heat (where) wicked angels dwell. \\
  Cast to Earth, unleashing spells, devouring your souls. \\

  Bow your heads to the supreme God, Lord of darkness. \\
  (Seduced nations denying Christ Satan leads the aggression.)
  
  Abbadon, leader of locust spawn, \\
  destroyer of all Christianity.
}









\subsection{Scrupulous rebels angst}
The more scrupulous of the rebels (\Damiarch{} and \Sithiyacaan) fear the evil that they have helped unleash. 
They angst over it. 

\lyricsbs{Exmortem}{Fix of Negativity}{
  My acid burnt eyes\\
  predicting the rise of evil. \\
  A quick fix of negativity, \\
  a lifetime in misery. \\
  Paranoia strikes hard. 
  
  With glass in my eyes, \\
  I see clearer now. \\
  Feel a touch of divine suffering. \\
  I am an angel with bloody hands.
}

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Wrath of the Ba'ath}{
  I saw their starved lips in the gloam. \\
  With horrid warning their still fuming mouths gaped wide. \\
  And I awoke, and found me here, \\
  the sole survivor writhing on the cold hill's side.
}









\subsection{\Gepheral becomes \Azraid}
\target{Azraid coup}





\subsubsection{\Gevural has an inner struggle}
\Gevural{} has an inner struggle. 
He is torn between \quo{good} and \quo{evil} and doesn't know what is right. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Kings of the Carnival Creation}{
  In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin, \\
  through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind.\\
  Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth.
  
  Confidently dawned, to pick the best of enemies.
  
  An abyss womb stretched wide open, exposed to retaliate.
}

\Daggerrain{} manipulates him, pulls him toward the darkness. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Kings of the Carnival Creation}{
  Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface,\\
  and enjoy the suffering, sanity drained in disrespect.\\
  With such bedevilled faith in good, subsequently trusting evil.\\
  Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin.
}

\Daggerrain{} tempts him with darkness and evil. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{The Maelstrom Mephisto}{
  Dwell in depths of the darker self, at any shore of infinity,\\
  and watch the relentless paint the soil black.\\
  What is being formed echoes throughout eternity,\\
  as the painter chooses color no more.
}





\subsubsection{\Gevural becomes \Azraid}
\Gevural{} claims some great power and takes the name \Azraid{}. 
He gains his \hs{dead hand}.

\lyricslimbonicart{Pits of the Cold Beyond}{
  As the shadows of dark angels fall\\
  from the grace of light,\\
  I am carried in the arms of death\\
  into the night.}

He floats through mystic dimensions. 

\lyricslimbonicart{Pits of the Cold Beyond}{
  The universe unveils\\
  a glowing entrance to doom,\\
  next to the setting sun \\
  and the rising moon.}

All the death and destruction gives him power.

\lyricslimbonicart{Pits of the Cold Beyond}{
  Wine of life streams\\
  in faint nocturnal screams.
  
  As the rivers run red\\
  from the wrath of Armageddon,\\
  and the wine of life is shed\\
  into the pits of the cold beyond.
}

Long after his sinister experiment, \Gevural{} lies in a coma. 
The other \resphan{} lords believe him to be dead and are about to elect a successor to take over his rank.

\lyricslimbonicart{Pits of the Cold Beyond}{
  At the time when the sun emerges from the dark,\\
  in limbo a star shines and in silver it sparks.\\
  I search my soul as darkness burns.\\
  For a shadow it shall return\\
  from the pits of the cold beyond.
}

\lyricslimbonicart{Unleashed From Hell}{
  Back from the dead, across the axis of dreams.\\
  A malicious hunger. The bloodline still streams.\\
  I am a martyr of the dark side,\\
  a tyrant in soul and flesh.
}





\subsubsection{\Azraid begins to hate the \banes}
\target{Azraid as Xanatos Sucker}
Through his transformation \Azraid gained new and terrible insight. 
He began to understand the \hs{dead universe}, which \Sethicus had also seen. 

\citebandsong{BlindGuardian:ANATO}{Blind Guardian}{The Soulforged}{
  And through the hour glass\\
  Everything's grey, everyone's pale\\
  Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart\\
  The seat of life's empty and cold\\
  Cadaverous you all seem to me\\
  Stillborn but you're still alive\\
  You're still alive
}

With his new occult insight, \Azraid began to realize that he and the rest of the \resphain had been manipulated from the start by \Daggerrain. 

Compare a \hr{Ramiel as Xanatos Sucker}{similar scene with Ramiel later on}. 
Also compare to the scene in \emph{\JuukenSentaiGekiranger} episode 46 (or so) where Rio discovers that his entire life has been masterminded by Long. 

Later, during the bloody war against \Merkyrah{}, he would come to realize that the \banes{} really cared nothing for the \resphain{} except as tools to use and discard. 

Thus he begins to hate the \banes. 
He still obeys the \banelords{} on the surface and does everything he can to further their schemes, but in secret he is plotting to overthrow them. 
It will take him twenty thousand years, but eventually he will betray and usurp \Banelord{} \Daggerrain. 









\subsection{\Morcariel stages a coup}
\target{Morcariel coup}
The leader of the rebellion is \Damiarch. 
But \Morcariel covets leadership for himself. 





\subsubsection{Contrast between \Damiarch and \Morcariel}
\Damiarch was much more idealistic. 
He genuinely believed that he fought for the liberation and enlightenment of his people and for their glorious destiny. 
He fought for a Utopia, and \trope{UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans}{Utopia Justifies the Means}. 

In contrast, \Morcariel was far more evil. 
He craved power for its own sake, and desired to rule in the name of Chaos and Darkness. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Callisto Rising}{
  Break the sidereal seal, brother!\\
  Open the astral portal! Give me the Lexicon\ldots{}\\
  give me that which is rightfully mine!\\
  Destroy the guardian-light\ldots{} Kill!
  
  Unfetter yourself, brother Zuranthus\ldots{}\\
  bestow upon me the shard which I seek\ldots{}\\
  give me my godhead, or I shall condemn your flaccid essence\\
  to a dimension of unparalleled pain! Kill!
}





\subsubsection{\Morcariel kills \Damiarch}
\target{Morcariel kills Damiarch}
\target{Morcariel betrays Damiarch}
\target{Azraid kills Damiarch}
\Daggerrain{} wants rid of \Damiarch. 
\Damiarch{} is too moral, too scrupulous for the \ps{\banelord}{} purposes. 
He needs someone more flexible, someone who will not shy away from things that, in \ps{\Daggerrain}{} grand scheme, need doing. 
He sees \Morcariel as a good candidate who would be willing to do all sorts of evil if goaded a bit. 

So \Daggerrain{} manipulates \Morcariel into murdering \Damiarch{} and enthroning himself as the lord of the \resphain. 

\Morcariel eats \Damiarch{} to gain his power. 

\lyricslimbonicart{The Black Hearts Nirvana}{
  Hallowed be the darkness that coronates my soul.\\
  Deep within its shelter I seek my highest goals.\\
  I shall release what is conquered \\
  from which that I now possess.\\
  All lifeforce is abandoned \\
  into the arms of death.
  
  Beyond the great dark adventures, \\
  in streams from the vast mysteries,\\
  limbonic spheres enclose me. \\
  My star is the death of memories.
}









\subsection{Destroy their faith}
The rebels learn that \Merkyrah{} is held together by a Shroud \hs{Mask}. 
In order to break the mask they must break the \Merkyran{} people's faith in their religion. 
Only then can they create a new world in their image. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Icons of Evil}{
  Defame the names of all your dead gods.\\
  Vomit upon the path of salvation.\\

  Confront me now, defiler of human desire.\\
  Voracious hordes await the hour of ascension.\\
  Unravel their delusion,\\
  their translucent divinity.

  Burn down the churches\ldots{} engulfed by hatred. \\
  Tear down the kingdom\ldots{} incinerate his vision. \\
  Destroy their icons\ldots{} pulled from their neck.\\
  The exodus of faith\ldots{} their will we did break.\\
  Shattering the hope they once loved. 
}

They force themselves to surrender the last vestiges of faith. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Infidel}{
  The infidel within me,  \\
  forever unbelieving. \\
  Purgate the stain of thy blessings. \\
  Obscure the light of Eden.
}

Some rebels are unsure and still think there are good things about \Merkyrah{} that are worth preserving. 
The mourn and angst over the fact that their inner goodness dies and is replaced by evil. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Infidel}{
  Taint the vision of purity. Heaven ravaged. \\
  A revelation of impurity has awakened. \\
  Your inner being withers from a lifetime of devotion. \\
  Never to hear the endless cries of the faithful.
}









\subsection{Orgies}
The rebels hold great orgies of sex and violence. 
Compare to Bequa Kynska's \emph{Maraviglia} in \authorbook{Graham McNeill}{Fulgrim}. 

Some of the \CiriathSepher{} feel that this is too vulgar, too uncivilized, too evil. 
This is one of the reasons for the \hr{Dynasties drift apart}{split between the dynasties}. 









\subsection{The Murder of the Dawn}
\target{Murder of the Dawn}
The deciding climax in the rebellion was the day of the \quo{Murder of the Dawn}. 
This is an Invocation of \Erebean{} Darkness. 
The dark ones \quo{murdered the dawn} by shifting the entire capital city into \Nyx, where eternal twilight reigns. 
The city is built using the power of \hr{Old Good Iquin}{(an early variant of) \iquin}, which is ultimately a filtered form of \nieur, which is \Nyx-based.
It opens a weak conduit to \Erebos. 

The \nephilim{} can clearly see that the dark ones are evil, so very few \nephilim{} join them. 
(Unlike \humans, \nephilim{} are not bred to serve the \resphain.) 
They are slaughtered in retaliation, and their whole race is nearly exterminated. 
Today \nephilim{} are rare because of this genocide. 

Perhaps the Murder of the Dawn is the \hr{Nyx was killed}{\quo{killing} of \Nyx} which turns \Nyx{} into a parasite Realm. 

\lyricsbs{Hate Eternal}{Para Bellum}{

}

The \hs{black stars} become visible in the sky. 
The \Merkyrans{} \hr{Merkyran myths of black stars}{had feared this}, so they despair. 
Many become truly convinced now that the rebels speak the truth and that their old way of life truly is doomed.

\subsubsection{\Merkyran magic fails}
\Merkyrah had a plethora of false myths and spells meant to protect against evil and invoke God.
The rebels preached that all this was a lie. 
They, on the other hand, had real magic with real power.

\subsubsection{Ramiel kills a champion}
There is a \Merkyran{} champion whom \Zachirah{} wants to kill. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Behold the Throne of Chaos}{
  Antagonist, come forth and defy my bloodwar \\
  at the first light of dawn. \\
  Crowned lord beheaded before me, glimpse your God dethroned. \\
  Iconoclast, the glorification of darkness, all is gone. \\
  He is dead.
}

But Ramiel demands the honour of slaying him. 
\Zachirah{} acquiesces and gives Ramiel his blessing. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Behold the Throne of Chaos}{
  Pureblood of iniquity, \\
  unfurl the wings of infamy. \\
  Seraph enthralled by desecration, \\
  our bloodwar towards completion. \\
  Purgate all thought on divination, \\
  the knell tolls on forever. \\
  Lightless, amid empyrean collapse, \\
  behold the Throne of Chaos. \\
  Lightless, amid empyrean ablaze, \\
  behold the Throne of Chaos. 
}

Ramiel prevails and rejoices, drunk on victory and enraptured by the destruction. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Behold the Throne of Chaos}{
  Deify my imperious vehemence. \\
  Their kingdom burns in flames. \\
  The ashes of God I bequeath, \\
  beneath our feet, defiled.

\Zachirah{} gloats. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Behold the Throne of Chaos}{
  They weep in the Sign of the Horns, \\
  glory to blasphemy of idols. \\
  Satanic Millenium, upheaval. \\
  Let the joyless be adorned with horns.

\subsection{Driven by hate}
\Damiarch{} was lots nicer about stuff. 
His ideals were enlightenment and fulfillment of his people's true potential. 
But \Morcariel{} and \Zachirah{} preach hate and destruction. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Gud's Fortapelse\dash{}\AA{}penbaring Av Dommedag}{

}





\subsubsection{They lose their innocence}
They are frenzied, obsessed with the need for destruction, and cannot stop even if they wanted to. 
Their vampiric nature has consumed them. 
This is the point where the \resphan{} people loses its \quo{innocence}. 
After this, there is no turning back. 
After all the atrocities they have committed against their own culture, the invasion of \Tembrae{} seems trivial. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{In Death's Embrace}{
  By the light of the Moon\\
  and the beings of the night,\\
  a curse has been laid upon us: \\
  To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces.
  
  By the power of Death\\
  and the shadow of the Reaper,\\
  a call has been brought upon us:\\
  To complete the infinite fall of Heaven.
}









\subsection{Angels and iconoclasm}
Maybe have some \uber-angels on the \Merkyran{} side. Perhaps these are the \hs{Voices of God} in physical form. 

They draw their power from some idols, statues, monuments, or even tablets of writing. Have a scene where a dark one, perhaps \Morcariel{} or \Ramiel, or even \Sithiyacaan, destroys these icons one by one and watches as the angels weep and weaken. 

Perhaps the angels are not \uber{} at all, but powerless and forced to watch. 

Compare to a scene in \FLuneNoireVol{11} (I think). 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{1567 - Under The Bloodcampaign}{
  Yea, we pull down the images of the false church.\\
  We pillage the temples of the popery.\\
  Defacing the paintings and tapestries of ancient Rome.\\
  With a fierce contempt we destroy the symbols of the dishonest.
}

\Zachirah{} laughs as he destroys the \Merkyran{} faith. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Forest of Flesh}{
  Bow for me, pathetic mortals, your God is dead for ages,\\
  impaled like thousands of your despised people.\\
  Eyes gazing glassy and vacant at the bloodred sky.\\
  Violently condemned to see your dying God above.

\subsubsection{\Morcariel reigned}
\target{Morcariel reigns}
\Morcariel reigned as High Lord of the new \resphan nation of \CiriathSepher, but he did not reign unchallenged. 
There were others, such as \Netzachirah and \Sithiyacaan, who disagreed with him and were influential enough to rival him. 

\Azraid was more ambiguous. 
He mostly supported \Morcariel, but \Azraid sort of represented \quo{evil with a \human face}.





\subsubsection{Soon they will summon the \banelords}
Soon the rebels would be able to summon the \banelords.
They looked forward to that.

\subsubsection{Slow rebuilding}
\target{Nyx rebuilt}
\Nyx was laid waste. 
More than hald of all \bezedeth and two thirds of all mortals perished. 
But the surviving pureblood \resphain were now stronger than ever, having gorged themselves on the flesh and souls of the fallen. 
They were sated, healthy and fertile, ready to rebuild. 

\Morcariel-tachi could now begin to build up a strong, sustainable, grim and brutal empire. 
They went to work replenishing their populations (of \resphain and mortals alike) and consolidating their power. 
Besides, \Morcariel needed to consolidate his position as High Lord. 

They rebuilt \Nyx into something beautiful, if grim and martial. 
It would remain beautiful until \hr{Ishnaruchaefir devastates Nyx}{\Ishnaruchaefir attacked and devastated it}. 

It would be hundreds of years before they were ready to attack \Tembrae. 























\chapter{\SecondbanewarBook}
% The story of the \secondbanewar, called the Incursion by the \resphain. 















\section{The \Resphain Prepare}
\subsection{The \Baelzerach schism}
Among the dark ones there was now a schism. They knew that they were spawned by \quo{Chaos and Darkness}. They disagreed over which parent was more important, Father Darkness or Mother Chaos. The majority voted for Darkness, but a minority held Chaos as the superior force. 

This faction became \Baelzerach. They split off from the other \resphain. 

Perhaps they followed a Satan-like god, or a super-powerful \resphan{} lord. And maybe his sexy daughter? Compare her to Lillith from \authorbook{\Francois{} Marcela Froideval}{666} (comic book series). 

The \Baelzerach{} did not fight against the \dragons{} in the \secondbanewar{}. Perhaps they even took the side of the \dragons{} (who were Chaos-aspected). Thus they became, and remained, far more friendly with \dragons{} than the rest of the \resphain. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} would go on to have \hr{Ishnaruchaefir and Baelzerach}{dealings with \Baelzerach}. 

%\Baelzerach{} splits off from the other evil \resphan{} factions. 

The \Baelzerach{} begin to invoke Chaos: 

\lyricsbs{Marduk}{Accuser/Opposer}{
  Accuser! Accuser!\\
  Exhaustless fountain of poison divine!\\
  I ate of Death to cleanse my flesh of God,\\
  to make me thy entrance to the veins of the world.\\
  Now as we turn to seek thy face,\\
  pour down on us thy redeeming wrath.
  
  Opposer! Opposer!\\
  Core, marrow and essence of my Will!\\
  I renounce this flesh in the name of thy praise,\\
  to kindle the coals of Salvation's spring.\\
  I drank of hell to cleanse my soul of God,\\
  to reach the light in which thou dwellest.
}







\subsection{\CiriathSepher ascendant}
\target{Kiriath-Sepher founded}
The remaining \resphain{} form the kingdom of \CiriathSepher{} to replace fallen \Merkyrah{}. (The other \resphan{} kingdoms later branch off from here.)

The conquest of \Merkyrah{} and the rise of \CiriathSepher{} paves the way for the \resphan{} race's ascent out of ignominy and into the glory they feel they deserve. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Thirteen Cryptical Prophecies of Mu}{
  [THE HIGH PRIEST OF MU:]\\
  Ascent to ecliptic! Mu and Poseidonis!
  
  [THE CHIEF CULTIST OF ZURRA:]\\
  The Emperor commands\ldots{} Uroboros to rise!
}

The regular \resphain{} are frightened by the new darkness. 
They turn to \Morcariel-tachi for leadership and guidance. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Cathedral of Corpses}{
  Beneath the shadow of thy throne \\
  still may we dwell secure.\\
  Suffering is thine arm alone \\
  and our defense is sure.
}

\Morcariel{} uses the \ashenblooded{} as artificial scapegoats. 
He wants to create a ranking system so the \resphain{} will feel good. 
Or something. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Cathedral of Corpses}{
  My word commands your flesh to dust: \\
  \quo{Return, ye sons of men!}\\
  Immortals rose from earth at first \\
  and my blood will live again.
}





\subsubsection{\CiriathSepher adopts \Merkyran traditions}
\target{Azraid adopts Merkyran imagery}
Under the command of \Morcariel and \Azraid, \CiriathSepher adopted much of \ps{\Merkyrah}{} imagery, aesthetics and perhaps even philosophy. 

\Azraid{} defends this, saying that the new empire must not reject everything that the people know, lest the people become unruly and difficult to control, and the empire grow inefficient.

Other \resphain{} object to \hr{Azraid's pragmatism}{\ps{\Azraid}{} pragmatism} and claim that he should be more true to the ideology of \quo{Darkness and Chaos}. 
This is one of the reasons why the \resphan dynasties \hr{Dynasties drift apart}{split off from each other}.

The other rebels also believe that they should reveal the entire truth to the people. But \Azraid{} wants to still keep many things hidden from the people and let many lies live on. The others protest, but acquiesce to \ps{\Azraid}{} plan. But it makes them bitter, and division is sown among the lords of \CiriathSepher. 









\subsection{\Bezedeth disappointed}
Many \bezedeth flocked to the rebellion because they were promised better conditions in the new world order. 
They became sorely disappointed after the rebellion. 
The rebel ideology could not bring them True Immortality, and their lot did not improve much.
They were not outcast, but they were still looked down on as inferior half-\resphain.









\subsection{They look forward to fighting \dragons}
The \resphain{} remember the \hr{Merkyran myths of Dragons}{\Merkyran{} myths of \dragons}. 
They are aching and excited to finally face these \dragons{} in combat. 
They want to take back what was once theirs. 

\lyricsbs{Aeternus}{Possessed by the Serpents Vengeance}{
  Your wrath coiled around the earth.\\
  Your venom courses it veins.\\
  Strike at their fear.\\
  Destroy their kingdoms\\
  with your poisonous rage.
}

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Demigod}{
  The great Persian serpent lies in wait.\\ 
  Let us face his army of immortals. \\
  We shall butcher those hunters of men's souls \\
  and crush their nimbus of immortality.
  
  A beast is approaching us. \\
  Its magnitude will blot out the Sun. \\
  We shall drink Persian blood \\
  and find our glory in the final arrow hail. 
  
  We blaspheme the tyrant.
  
  Under the banner of [\Mystraacht]. \\
  For the eternal glory of [\Nyx]. 
}









\subsection{Learning \Miithian languages}
\target{Resphain learn Miithian languages}
% The \resphain{} learn some of the \Draconic{} tongue from the \banelords{} (who have been monitoring \Miith{} for millennia), so that they can communicate and deal with their foes. 
% They also study the \psp{\dragons}{} magic, weapons, physique, psychology and culture, so they are better equipped to fight them. 

The \resphain did not learn the \draconic tongue before they began the Incursion. 
They learned it slowly afterwards, but only few ever learned it and none ever truly mastered it.
The \dragons were not interested in teaching it to them, but the \resphain learned quite a bit from some \quiljaaran whom they got persuaded or coerced into cooperating.

\hr{Resphain speak poor Draconic}{Only very few \resphain ever mastered the \Draconic tongue}. 

But the \resphain did make some effort to study the \psp{\dragons}{} magic, weapons, physique, psychology and culture, so they are better equipped to fight them. 










\subsection{\Resphain{} come to \Tembrae{} in spaceships}
\target{Resphain come down in spaceships}
\index{technology!\bane}
\Merkyrah{} was not in \Tembrae{} but in \Nyx. 
The \resphain{} of newly-formed \CiriathSepher{} had to travel to \Tembrae{} in spaceships (\hr{Bane technology}{\voyager{} relics}). 

So they came to \Tembrae{}, descending from the sky in chariots of fire, like the gods they were. 
They conquered the primitive, savage \humans{} living there. 

Since then, \humans{} have had myths about how the gods (\resphain) came from the sky/stars in burning ships or chariots, to liberate them from the depredations of the wicked \dragons{} and their spawn.





\subsubsection{Population}
At this time, the total population of all \resphain{} was in the range of 100,000--200,000. 





\subsubsection{They marvel at the \Wylde}
\hr{Merkyrah is one huge city}{\Merkyrah{} was one huge city}, so the \resphain{} had never seen \Wylde{} nature before. 
They marvelled at the sight, but it also frightened them. 
Some of them became convinced that this new world was a savage, backward land that they must conquer and civilize. 

Yet others simply enjoyed the beauty and coolness. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Stien}{

}

Nature was both frightening and compelling to them. 
They could sense the immense power and life force around them. 
See, \Nyx{} was \hr{Nyx is far from the Heart}{farther removed from the Heart of \Miith}, and therefore it could not be felt to the same extent. 
\hr{Nyx is a parasite Realm}{\Nyx{} lived by leeching off this life}, but here in \Tembrae{} it could be felt in its undiluted form.

\subsubsection{The savage \humans}
\index{technology!\human}
The early \humans{} who escaped the fall of \ps{\Semiza}{} kingdom and fled into the wild formed their primitive tribes. They were barbarians, stone age level, or bronze age at best. \Humans{} are too stupid to create any non-trivial civilization on their own. They only gained more technology when the \resphain{} came and took control. If they had bronze age technology, then it was stolen from the \scathae. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Origin}{

  And God-slaves we are,\\
  suffering in the mines of our Masters.\\
  We populate the fields of E.DIN,\\
  the base of the Gods from Nibiru-Pha\"eton.
}

The \humans{} did have \hs{myths} about \Thanatzil, \Semiza{} and the \resphain. 
They worshipped them as absent gods. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Deus Ex Machina}{
  I built temples, statues and pyramids \\
  as monuments of my endless might.\\
  Colossal knowledge lays hidden in tablets and shrines, \\
  protected by spells and incantations.

  I gave thee science \\
  and I delivered thee from bestiality.\\
  My name was carved in thousands of stones \\
  and diurnally murmured in deadly incantations.\\
  Atlantis was built when you amoebas crawled through filth. \\
  I am Holiness Divine, your Lord and Master, \\
  the Supreme God and Creator.
}

They have myths about a saviour god named \quo{Anatheal} or a variant thereof. 
This is a corruption of \hr{Thanatzil}{\Thanatzil}. 
According to myth, Anatheal came to them a thousand years ago to create an eternal paradise for \humans{} where they would live in bliss alongside his angels. 
But \humans{} were wicked and sinful, and they wasted Anatheal's precious sacrifice. 
Now they are condemned to live as filth, preyed upon by the \dragons{} and their spawn, until the day when Anatheal will return. 









\subsection{Hiding in \Nyx}
Perhaps the \resphain{} used \Nyx{} to hide their cities and lands from the \dragons{} while they built their empires. 









\subsection{They need the stargate}
The \resphain{} need \hr{Semiza's stargate}{\ps{\Semiza}{} stargate}. 
After \ps{\Thanatzil}{} fall, \hr{Semiza flung away}{\Semiza{} was flung far away} from the stargate. 
The \resphain{} must find, exhume and restore it. 

They must also find \Semiza{} again (since \hr{Rebels lose Semiza}{they lost him}). 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Deus Ex Machina}{
  The sacred altars erected for the Sun-God \\
  point at the sky as a tremendous beacon. \\
  The Heavengate was sealed and buried forever. \\

  and the Door to Heaven is unsealed again, \\
  then I shall return to restore my immense power.\\ 
  Thou shall be enslaved again.
}





\subsubsection{They find \Semiza}
\target{Semiza becomes a Lich}
They found \Semiza{} again. 
He told them more about the \banes. 
Among other things, he told them about the \hr{Bane telekinesis}{\pps{\banes}{} tactile language} and how that tied in with their names (like \quo{\hr{Daggerrain}{\Daggerrain}}). 

The \resphain resurrected \Semiza as a \Lich.
It was traumatic for him, and also for some of them, for it involved some pretty wicked magic.

\subsection{\Resphan-\aryoth{} alliance}
\target{Resphan-Aryoth alliance}
The \aryothim{} and \vorcanths{} had often warred against the \dragons, and the \quiljaaran{} for that matter. 
Some \resphain{}, having caught wind of this, recognized the \aryothim{} and \vorcanths{} as potential allies and sent a delegation to find some of their great and respected elders. 
Ramiel and \Shiaraid{} were the leaders of this delegation. 

They managed to sway many of the \aryothim{}, who joined their war, but only few of the \vorcanths{}. 
Most \vorcanths{} elected to remain neutral. 

During the war there were several \aryoth{} kings and chieftains who fought and argued among each other over how they should act in the war, on which side they should fight and under which conditions. 
They were as diverse as any other race.

Gradually, the \dragons{} became less and less fertile, and fewer live children hatched. 
But the \banelords{} had hidden \hr{Merkyrah}{\Merkyrah} well, so the \dragons{} couldn't figure out what was causing it. 
For thousands of years they grieve and research and try to find out why their eggs die, but they can't find anything conclusive, only some vague astrological \hr{Matrix}{\matrix} mumbojumbo. 

Only when the \resphain{} reveal themselves do the \dragons{} piece together the true answer.   

The \dragons originally had \hr{Draconic names for Banes}{other names for the \banes}. 









\subsection{Awakening the \banelords}
%They create the \resphain. When they have enough \resphain, they blast open the doorway from \Nyx{} into \Miith{} and march forth, proudly announcing to the world the beginning of the \secondbanewar. 
%The \hr{Resphan rebellion}{rebellious \resphain} have conquered the \hr{Good Resphan Empire}{previously good \resphan{} empire}. 
The dark ones are victorious and now control the \resphan{} empire. 
%They now reopen the gate to \Nyx{} and summon \banes{} to their aid. 

In the beginning, they waged wars with \dragons{} and their ilk here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The \dragons{} knew that a new religion had risen to prominence among the \resphain, but paid it little heed. Very few \dragons{} suspected that the \quo\banes{} whom the \resphain{} now worshipped as their creations were the same as the ancient foe of \dragonkind. They simply believed that the \resphain{} had discovered some new magic and concocted a fictional mythology to surround it, as so many cultures had done before them. So they still wasted their strength on internal wars. They did not fear the \Nyx-aspected magic, for it had existed for thousands of years and never been a real threat to the \dragons. 

%They resume contact with the \banelords{} and summon \banes{} to their aid. When they have enough strength, they blast open the doorway from \Nyx{} into \Miith{} and march forth, proudly announcing to the world the beginning of the \secondbanewar. 
But at last the rebels succeed in penetrating the \hr{Crystal Sphere}{\CrystalSphere} and contacting \Daggerrain. They have high expectations of the \banes{}.

The \banelords themselves are unable to come through, but they can communicate with the \resphain{}, and they can send \lesserbanes{} to their aid. 

The \resphan{} lord gathered their strength, consolidated their sovereignty over their race, as well as the \humans{} and the few surviving \nephilim, now slaves. And they laid plans\dash against the \dragons, and against each other. They also received technology from \Erebos, and they did research to refine it and create new technology.

\Zachirah-tachi were especially eager to meet their \banelords.

}









\subsection{The \Sathariah project}
The \resphain{} and their \bane{} masters lay sinister plans to gain more power. The \resphain{} already possess some measure of Chaotic power, but they crave more. To do this they needed \draconic{} blood. 

After much preparation\dash decades, perhaps\dash the \resphain{} are ready. They have concocted an elaborate plan to capture one of the \shaeeroths{}, slay him and used his blood and life-force to empower their new generation of \resphain\dash the \hr{Sathariah}{\satharioth}, who would go on to become the mightiest of them all. 

%So in an elaborate plan, the \banes{} captured the \dragonking{} \Nexagglachel{}, killed him and used his blood and life-force to empower their new generation of \resphain, who went on to become the mightiest of them all. Ramiel and \Shiaraid{} belong to this group. 
They set their eyes on \Ishnaruchaefir.







\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir has premonitions}
Somehow, \Ishnaruchaefir{} has premonitions. 
Perhaps he uses divination magic. 
He sees visions of being betrayed, imprisoned, tortured and slowly killed. 
He sees his body and soul being cut into pieces and devoured by ravenous horrors (the would-be \satharioth). 
He sees himself impaled on a tree of thorns, his blood drained and his flesh peeled off in strips. (See section \ref{Nexagglachel in captivity}.) 
He sees visions of death, eternal war and the destruction of the world.

}

Also compare to the visions of Hell in the movies \emph{Hellraiser} and \emph{Event Horizon}. 

The reason why it is \Ishnaruchaefir{} and not \Secherdamon{} who sees these visions is twofold:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    It is \Ishnaruchaefir{} who is the \ps{\resphain} intended target.  
    They have already began weaving subtle spells to entrap him. 
    These spells are not quite subtle enough, and he picks up on them. 
  \item 
    \Secherdamon{} was always very goal-oriented and focused his research on the \xss. 
    \Ishnaruchaefir{} was focused and had a wider range of interests. 
    He tended to gaze out into the universe rather than narrowly into the \psp{\dragons}{} past. 
    He cared about the cosmic gods and the more elusive mysteries of existence\dash mysteries that might have no solution at all, and might have no practical application even if solved. 
    (\Secherdamon{} ignored these questions for those reasons.)
    
    \Nexagglachel{} was not so much into sorcery. 
    He was more absorbed in earthly matters of politics. 
    
    This made \Ishnaruchaefir{} more sensitive to alien things than his brothers, so he could feel these dreams when the \resphain{} approached. 
\end{enumerate}








\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir seeks the advice of elders}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} dreads this horrible fate. 
He seeks out wise elder \ophidians{} and \nagalords{} and asks for their advice. 



\subsubsection{Searching for the elders}
He goes to a dark, menacing place where these elders live. 
Perhaps this place is a \hr{Black pyramids}{\quo{black pyramid}}, as in \bandsong{Bal-Sagoth}{Shadows 'Neath the Black Pyramid}, or an ancient, cyclopean castle, as in \bandsong{Bal-Sagoth}{Into the Silent Chambers of the Sapphirean Throne (Sagas from the Antediluvian Scrolls)}.

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{

\subsubsection{The elders' advice}
The elders are expert diviners and are able to show him more detailed visions of the future\ldots{} a future full of darkness, blood, death and eternal war.

}





\subsubsection{He is one of few who can stop it}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} is told that he is one of the few who have a realistic chance of changing this fate. 
This is due to a number of things: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item He is fucking badass.
  \item He is a powerful \vertex.
  \item He is at the centre of \ps{\Daggerrain}{} plan, since he is the \dragon{} whom they plan to use for their \sathariah{} project. 
\end{itemize}

  All is grim darkness and all is war. \\
  Only you have the power to stop this future. \\
  You must be strong, Warmaster. \\
  Never forget that.

\subsubsection{\ps{\Criseis}{} point of view}
\Criseis{} camps outside and finally sees her lord return from the sinister dwelling of the ancients.

Have flashbacks about this! Possibly from \ps{\Criseis}{} point of view. And later have some conversations where one of the elders reveal to a third/fourth person what transpired. (Yeah, \emph{Malazan Book of the Fallen} style.)





\subsubsection{Origin of the glaive}
Perhaps \Ishnaruchaefir{} gains or forges \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's glaive}{his glaive} here.

\subsection{The Fall of \Nexagglachel}





\subsubsection{Capturing \Nexagglachel}
\target{Fall of Nexagglachel}
\target{Death of Nexagglachel}
\target{Origin of Satharioth}
In an attempt to prevent this dreaful fate\dash for himself and for the world\dash \Ishnaruchaefir{} seeks out his brother \Nexagglachel{} for help. 

Perhaps \Nexagglachel{} has seen similar visions, but was afraid to seem weak or mad in front of his backstabbing fellow \dragons, so he kept it secret. 
Compare him to King Leoric in the \emph{Madness of the Black King} story arc in the game \emph{Diablo}. 

The brothers fight against the \banes. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} fights hard, both for himself and his brother, but in the end he fails. 
He lives, but \Nexagglachel{} falls instead. 
The \banes{} and \resphain{} are happy, having succeeded beyond their expectations and captured the mightiest of the three brothers, instead of just the second mightiest. 
So they use his blood, and the \satharioth{} are born. 
See section \ref{Nexagglachel in captivity}.

\Nexagglachel killed many \resphain before he was killed and captured.
When he revived, he was surprised to see that several of the killed \resphain had also revived.
They possessed \hs{True Immortality}.
He realized this was a foe to be reckoned with.






\subsubsection{\Nexagglachel{} in captivity}
\target{Nexagglachel in captivity}
\Nexagglachel{} was captured by the \banes{}. 
There he was tortured physically, magically and psychologically. 
He was crucified and impaled on a giant tree of thorns, and his blood and power was drained from him.

But through it all, he never surrendered, or even faltered. His pride and dignity remained intact, and he was able to mock his captors throughout his captivity, untill they finally killed him and drained the last of his life force and soul to create the \satharioth. 

See, as a son of \KhothSell{} he is, in a sense, an incarnation of Death. He fears neither death nor pain, and actively enjoys physical pain. So he laughs every time the \resphain{} ram another spike through his body.

After \Nexagglachel was taken prisoner:
\Nexagglachel learned the \resphan tongue by telepathically attacking a \resphan.
This was a sneak attack that took his captors completely by surprise.
\Nexagglachel was able to kill, destroy and devour his victim before the \resphain could stop him.
He learned much from the \resphan's mind.
He took from him many secrets about their origins, their plans, their technology and magic and their language.

\Nexagglachel did much to sow the seeds of doubt, fear, discord and rivalry among his \resphan captors, even when alive.
He would goad them on and manipulate them.
When they tried to interrogate him he would give them \trope{HannibalLecture}{Hannibal Lectures} instead.
He helped shape \Azraid into the very critical \resphan he later became.
And he shaped \Sithiyacaan into a rebel leader.
And \Shiaraid into a dangerous maverick.





\subsubsection{They taunt him}
Some of the wannabe-\Satharioth{} taunt \Nexagglachel. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Entwined by Vengeance}{
  Ageless and obscure. \\
  Feel the burning in my heart. \\
  My eyes have seen the truth. \\
  Now my hands will tear your fucking God apart. \\
  
  In the name of Satan, \\

  Decimate the holy land, \\
  for pain is now your savior.
  
  In this season of monumental horror, \\
  we hunger for heavenly termination. \\
  Of blood and war. We shall devour.
}





\subsubsection{His cold eyes}
\target{Nexagglachel's hatred}
\Nexagglachel stared back at the \resphain with his \hr{Nexagglachel's appearance}{cold, black eyes}. 
Even when he roared in pain and anger, his eyes retained their unfazed coldness. 
Remember, he was a \dragon, and \dragons relished combat, conflict, violence and pain. 
He enjoyed the challenge, even though he was convinced he was doomed. 
He was planning his long-term revenge. 

He told them: 
\ta{With every attack you only strengthen me.
  Every attack feeds my hatred. 
  The hatred that will devour you and your kind from within.
  I will be your downfall, \satharioth.
  Forever you will feel my cold eyes.
  Forever you will feel my hate.
  I will be the cancer that eats away at your being, until the day your people is destroyed.}

His pride drove his captors mad. 
They tried everything to break him, but to no avail. 
He was unbreakable. 





\subsubsection{\Nexagglachel and \Azraid reach an understanding}
\Nexagglachel{} and \Azraid{} look into each other's eyes. 
They both see the same fear manifested: 
The fear that the \banes{} will win and end up devouring both of their races in their hunger. 
They want to avoid that. 
To that end, both are willing to make any sacrifice. 

They reach a silent, unspoken understanding. 
They will work together in utmost secrecy in a \XanatosGambit{} that will take many thousands of years. 
Together they will overthrow the \banes. 

Maybe \Damiarch{} still lives at this point, and \Nexagglachel{} inspires \Azraid{} to kill him. 
But probably not. 





\subsubsection{He breaks free}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir gains stewardship}
\index{stewardship}
Through his captivity, the \resphain{} made sure to keep \Nexagglachel{} blocked so that he cannot telepathically contact the outside world. 

At one point \Nexagglachel{} escaped. 
He broke free of their block and managed to contact \Ishnaruchaefir{} and warn him of the \ps{\resphain} plan, so they could be ready for what is to come. 

He told \Ishnaruchaefir{} that he would die. 
He passed on the mantle of the stewardship of \Miith{} to \Ishnaruchaefir. 
It would now fall to \Ishnaruchaefir{} to lead the \dragons{} and defend the planet against invaders. 

He told \Ishnaruchaefir{} of \hr{Nexagglachel gets stewardship}{the time when \TyarithXserasshana{} had given \emph{him} the stewardship}. 
Now he would pass it on to \Ishnaruchaefir. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} expressed his doubt. 
He was not confident that he was up to the task. 
He had always been a loner, not a social sort, and least of all a leader of an entire people. 

But \Nexagglachel{} was certain he could: 
\begin{prose}
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{I cannot do this. 
    \Raemyth, I am not thou!
    I own not thy strength!}
  
  \Nexagglachel: 
  \ta{Yea, \Quessanth. 
    Thou art stronger than thou knowest.
    Strong enough to do what must be done.
    Thou art the best of us.
    \Irocas{} is skilled, but brittle. 
    He possesseth not thy solid foundation.
    Thou must take leadership.}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir:
  \ta{Very well, \Raemyth.
    I will do what thou askest of me.
    I accept the mantle of stewardship. 
    I will find in me the strength to do what must be done.
    I will not fail thee, brother.}
\end{prose}

This ended up \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's stewardship}{shaping \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} life}. 

\target{Ishnaruchaefir learns Azraid is on the level}
\Nexagglachel also told \Ishnaruchaefir of the various \resphan lords; which ones to beware. 
\Ishnaruchaefir learned that \Azraid was one of the better of them. 
He could be made to see reason. 
Later the two \hr{Ishnaruchaefir and Azraid develop empathy}{would develop an understanding}.

\Nexagglachel{} knew he was going to die. 
He did not expect to be rescued. 
So he went along with it. 
He plotted his own \XanatosGambit. 
He would live on as a ghost in the \satharioth{} and bestow upon them a curse to bring them down. 

Soon after, he was killed and his soul recaptured (his body regrows in captivity). 

Compare to the scene with Tai-Lung's escape in the movie \emph{Kung-Fu Panda}. 

\Secherdamon{} is hurt and angry that \Nexagglachel{} would choose to trust \Ishnaruchaefir{} rather than him, even after \Ishnaruchaefir{} failed him and was responsible for getting \Nexagglachel{} captured in the first place. 
This makes \Secherdamon{} doubly grim and ambitious and determined to prove his worth. 









\subsection{The birth of the \Satharioth}
\subsubsection{Some \satharioth{} die}
\target{Satharioth die}
Originally there were many more than thirteen \satharioth. 
Maybe there were around 30. 
But they underestimated \Nexagglachel, and when they siphoned power from him, he seized control and lashed back.
He managed to destroy some of the would-be \satharioth.
He let them drain some of his essence, but also sent a portion of his will and malevolence into their bodies.
(A larger portion than into the others, that is.)
This way he was able to destroy them from within, causing them to tear themselves apart in pain, frenzy and madness.

He knew he could not kill them all, so he endeavoured to kill those he hated most, and some of those who could be the greatest threats (including \hr{Kezrabal}{\Kezrabal}). 
He tried hard to kill \Morcariel, but failed. 
But he let \Azraid, \Zachirah, Ramiel and \Sithiyacaan{} live because he foresaw that they might cause trouble and dissension among the \resphain.

\subsubsection{\Nexagglachel lived on}
\target{Nexagglachel lives on in Satharioth}
After \Nexagglachel's death, his soul lived on in fragments inside the \satharioth.
The \resphain never understood this phenomenon. 
They never understood that \draconian immortality was something greater and more profound than their own immortality.
They did not understand the idea that a soul could be destroyed and devoured and yet live on and retain consciousness. 
The \resphain had no Gnosis of the Aenigmata that \KhothSell had taught to her followers.

\subsection{The \satharioth begin to feel the curse}
Soon after their inception, the \satharioth{} begin to feel \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse}. 
They begin to wonder if this whole project was a good idea.

\lyricslimbonicart{The Yawning Abyss of Madness}{
  Again I drift the halls of wondering. \\
  The black castle of solitude. \\
  On the very edge of sanity \\
  in mental cryogenic interludes. \\
  I have slipped into the seventh, \\

  in realms where deadly shadows \\
  infest every cell. 
  
  Internal ceremonies in ritual death. \\
  External bleedings for the demon of madness. \\
  Hide from the torture of the dazzling light. \\
  The demolition voice shall speak tonight. 
  
  While I'm staring down into the darkest pit, \\
  an ocean black as the night, \\
  so infinite deep and consuming, \\
  it swallows all life force with might. 
  
  Again I drift the halls of wondering, \\
  as I focus for the darkness to come. \\
  In anguish minds uplift the conquering \\
  to cross the line of death beyond.
  
  An abstract reality and bottomless insanity. \\
  To search for the powers to please\\
  the subconscious spirit of disease. \\
  Time found no remedy, \\

  The yawning abyss of madness. \\
  A cryptic slaughter by hate. \\

\index{Incursion}
The dreaded \satharioth{} march forth, legions of \banes{} and monsters at their back, 
announcing to all of \Miith{} the beginning of the \secondbanewar.
Or \quo{the Incursion}, as the \resphain{} call it.

\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} and \Secherdamon}
\target{Early conflict between Ishnaruchaefir and Secherdamon}
Have lots of conflict between the two brothers. 
\Secherdamon{} blamed \Ishnaruchaefir{} for \ps{\Nexagglachel} death, and much more. 
They fought and hated each other. 

After \ps{\Nexagglachel} death, there was much dispute about who, if anyone, should inherit his place as leader of the \dragons{}. 

\index{stewardship}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} claimed that \Nexagglachel, in their last conversation, had named him his successor and passed on the mantle of stewardship to him. 
But they only had his word for it. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} was a great and acknowledged warrior and hero already before the \secondbanewar, so he argued that he would make a better war leader. 
\Secherdamon{} was famous for his more peaceful achievements. 
He was a scientist and philosopher and artist.
A nerd, where his brother was a macho-man. 

\Secherdamon{} argued that he really was more skilled. 
\ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} accomplishments looked flashy, but they were all things of destruction. 
\Secherdamon{} was a \emph{creator}, and it took much more expertise to create than destroy. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} countered, saying that creation was all fine and dandy in peace time, but this was war, and a destroyer was needed, 

\target{Ishnaruchaefir gains title of Destroyer}
Hence arose \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} title of \hs{Destroyer}. 
It was used for him in the war: 
\begin{prose}
  \ta{Beware! Flee for your lives! Here comes the Destroyer!}
\end{prose}

Later, \Secherdamon{} would muse that people ought to call \emph{him} the \quo{Creator}, in contrast. 

In the end, \Ishnaruchaefir{} won and was accepted as \ps{\Nexagglachel} successor. 
Even though \Secherdamon, being more of a team player and less of a loner, might have made a better leader. 











\subsection{The first battle}
A \resphan{} army marches against a \draconic{} city for the very first time.

\subsection{The \Dragons{} unite}
\target{Second Banewar unites Dragons}
The \dragons{} had been \hr{Dragons disorganized}{terribly disorganized} ever since the \firstbanewar, despite \ps{\Nexagglachel} heroic efforts. 
But the appearance of a clear external menace\dash and one powerful enough to pose a genuine threat, exemplified by the killing of \Nexagglachel\dash finally roused them, and they managed to unite, at least for a time. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} acted as a leader of sorts, but reluctantly. 
He was never socially skilled enough to lead the \dragons. 









\subsection{\Zachirah as the Dark Warlord}
\Zachirah{} commands the armies of the \resphain{}. 
He is the most skilled warlord of them, being the most brutal and aggressive of the \satharioth. 
He drives his armies on with bloodlust, hunger and hate. 

\lyricsdimmuborgir{Antikrist}{

\subsection[Shiaraid and Eryal]{\Shiaraid and \Eryal}
\target{Shiaraid and Eryal driven apart}
\Shiaraid{} and \Eryal{} were lesbian lovers already back then. 
They had been for some time. 
Their relationship was sado-masochistic, with \Shiaraid{} dominant and \Eryal{} submissive. 
It used to be healthy and pleasant for both parts. 
\Shiaraid{} knew how far she could go and respected \Eryal{} even when she tortured her. 

But after she became a \sathariah, \ps{\Shiaraid} mind gradually became twisted by \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse}. 
Her sado-masochism became a \hr{Self-destructive Shiaraid}{self-destructive madness}. 
She became abusive and downright evil to poor \Eryal. 
They loved each other, but \Shiaraid{} was going mad. 
The Curse broke both their hearts and drove them apart. 

\target{Shiaraid and Eryal break up}
It came to an ugly break between them. 
The ensuing heartbreak was one of the reasons why \Shiaraid{} and \Mystraacht{} later fell from grace, while \Eryal{} became one of the \hr{Founding of Kezerad}{founders of \Kezerad}. 









\subsection{Dynasties drift apart}
\target{Dynasties drift apart}
In the beginning, \Azraid was the dark, mysterious necromancer-king, ruler of all, and \Zachirah was his bloodhound. 
It did not last.
\Zachirah grew disgruntled with \Azraid's leadership. 
He began to see \Azraid as a wuss and resented serving under him. 

Besides, \Zachirah remembered how \Azraid had himself usurped his brother's place.
\Zachirah decided it was his time to usurp \Azraid. 

\Zachirah's rebellion was a catalyst that triggered more rebellions.
The \resphain began to split apart into many factions (only much later stabilizing into the famous dynasties). 
\hr{Dynasties split}{The final split} did not happen until after the Shrouding, but there was much unrest and scheming and infighting already during the Incursion War. 
This infighting was one of the major reasons why the \resphain did not win the war: 
They lost their unity, which was one of their greatest assets against the chaotic \dragonlords. 









\subsection{Battle scenes}
Have a battle scene where a few \dragons{} mow down mortals by the thousands. 
Show how worthless and impotent humanoids are compared to \dragons.

\lyricsflnv{10}{
  The passage of the Golden \Dragons{} and the Emperor completely destroyed the knights. 
  In one stroke of lightning, Wismerhill had lost his best forces. 
  The high nobility of the Black Moon had been annihilated!
}

Have another battle scene, or the same, where \dragons{} fight against \banes{} and their monsters. There is slaughter inflicted on both sides, with only selected super-heroes being untouched. 

\lyricsflnv{10}{
  Only the Emperor's \Dragon{} seemed untouchable, and it even managed to hold its own against the Lords of Negation. 
  The Emperor was truly a terrifying opponent.
}









\subsection{World tree destroyed}
In this age the \dragons had a \quo{world tree}. 
It was a humongous living machine that looked sort of like a giant tree or bush. 
It was an \trope{EldritchAbomination}{Eldritch Abomination}, a horror that fed on the blood, flesh and souls of living creatures. 
But in return, it fed the earth so farmers could grow stuff. 
It was a central keystone in the ecosystem of the world in those days. 
It sucked up the power of the Heart of \Miith and distributed it to the people through its roots which reached deep into the earth and thousands of kilometres out through the land. 

It was a horror, but it had been there for hundreds of years, so the people were used to it and worshipped it as a godlike thing, alongside the \dragons which were its masters. 
The people relied on the tree for their livelihoods. 

The \resphain saw none of this. 
When they saw the tree, they saw only a cancerous monstrosity that leeched energy from the planet and ate the flesh of its denizens. 
It was an abomination and just went to demonstrate how monstrous and evil the \dragons were. 
The \resphain would liberate \Miith from this blight and then destroy the wicked \dragons. 
So they attacked and destroyed the tree. 

This was a tragedy and a catastrophic blow for the \dragons and the denizens of \Tembrae.
Their ecosystem and economy suddenly collapsed overnight. 

Compare to the scene in the movie \cite{Movie:Avatar} where the \humans bomb the Na'vi Home Tree. 

\Rystessakhin mourned the loss of the tree. 

\citebandsong{BlindGuardian:NIME}{Blind Guardian}{Nightfall}{
  No sign of life did flicker.
  In floods of tears she cried:
  \ta{All hope's lost. It can't be undone.
    They're wasted and gone.}

\Rystessakhin remembered the fall of \Nexagglachel, the first tragedy of the Incursion. 

\citebandsong{BlindGuardian:NIME}{Blind Guardian}{Nightfall}{
  \ta{Monstrous it covered the shore
    Fearful into the unknown}
  Quietly it crept in new horror
  Insanity reigned

}





\subsubsection{\Sithiyacaan realizes it}
\Sithiyacaan realized that the tree was not pure evil, but a vital necessity for the \Tembraeans. 
This made him question his people's right to conquer. 
He realized that the \bane propaganda was false. 
The \resphain were not benevolent heroes fighting against the evil \dragons. 

Later he began to feel \NexagglachelsCurse. 
He feared it. 
He began to repent his people's evil.

\subsection[Aryothim abandon alliance]{\Aryothim{} abandon alliance}
The \aryothim{} (and the few \vorcanths{}) gradually found out that the \resphain{} were in league with the \banes, and that the \banes{} were genocidally evil. 
They were nonplussed, so they seceded from \hr{Resphan-Aryoth alliance}{their alliance with the \resphain}. 
They retreated to Visha and remained mostly neutral. 

But the \vorcanths{} were very loyal by nature, so even if they would no longer fight in the \ps{\resphain} war, the bonds of friendship they had tied with individual \resphain{} (including Ramiel and \Shiaraid) survived. 





\subsubsection[Aryothim went downhill]{\Aryothim{} went downhill}
It went ill for the \aryothim. 
They had suffered many losses in the war. 
After they seceded from the alliance it got no better. 
Now both sides in the \feud{} hated them. 

The different \aryoth{} tribes also hated one another. 
Some tribes hated the others for \quo{tricking} them into the alliance, and the others hated the first group for tricking them \emph{out} of the alliance. 

Their only support were the \vorcanths, and they didn't give any hard and fast promises.

\subsubsection{Diseases}
When the \resphain invaded from \Nyx, they and their mortal armies brought with them many new, nasty diseases from \Nyx.
And they, in turn, encountered \Tembraean diseases foreign to them.
The immortals were too resilient to succumb to mere mortal diseases, but the mortal \Tembraeans and \Nyxians were not so lucky.
They died in droves.
\Tembrae was ravaged by deadly epidemies, further compounding the horror and carnage of the \secondbanewar.

But the \secondbanewar lasted more than 100 years, and it was fought chiefly with immortal armies.
The epidemies were a great problem for logistics since they killed a lot of servants and food sources, but they were not as great a problem as some other aspects of that time.
When the \secondbanewar was over, the epidemies had run their course and the survivors had developed resistance.









\subsection{It looks hopeless}
The war was going badly for the \Miithian s. 
It looked hopeless. 
The \bane{} hordes were endless. 

Compare to the hordes of Chaos in \cite{RPG:Warhammer:HighElves} and other \emph{Warhammer} titles. 




\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir is a poor leader}
At this point, \Ishnaruchaefir{} had been grudgingly accepted as \emph{de facto} \dragonlord{} and leader of the \dragons.
He did his best to lead because he felt he had to, but he was no great leader nor tactical genius. 

He was an able leader who won through by sheer willpower, courage, daring and brute force, but he also made some major strategic blunders. 
Moreover, he was already becoming alienated from his fellow \dragons{}, which made him more and more self-sufficient and unwilling to listen to advice, which made everything worse. 





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir's sons die}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir's sons die}
\Ishnaruchaefir had three sons:
\hr{Tentocoth}{Tentocoth}, \hr{Thiencaste}{\Thiencaste} and \hr{Rathyon}{\Rathyon}. 
The three were close friends and great, brave warriors. 
In one of the first great battles against the \resphain the three brothers led the \draconian forces and fought from the frontline.

There was a great tragic battle.
Some very important monuments were destroyed, immense numbers of soldiers and civilians died, and the three heroic brothers perished. 

Compare to the battle in \cite{Movie:Avatar} where the Home Tree is destroyed. 





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir takes drastic measures}
The news of his sons' death hardened \Ishnaruchaefir. 
He decided drastic measures had to be taken. 
He wanted to call upon darker, forbidden powers. 
He decided to seek out \NerrhanKoss, the darkest, most horrible, most frightening of the \xss, and make a pact with him. 

His fellow \dragons{} were against this. 
They feared that the power of \NerrhanKoss{} was too dark, too evil, and that if they called upon him for aid it would corrupt and doom them and call down eternal tragedy upon their kind and all \Miith. 

\Ishnaruchaefir did not care.
He was willing to do whatever it took and pay any price. 
He cared not for his reputation.

\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir gains the glaive}
\target{Glaive origin}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} went on, heedless of their warnings. 
He was willing to pay any price. 
So went to a dark shrine of \hr{Nerrhan-Koss}{\NerrhanKoss} and made his pact. 

Here he gained his \hs{glaive}. 
It was a gift of sorts from \NerrhanKoss. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} forged it himself (using magic), but \NerrhanKoss{} taught him how. 
Maybe \NerrhanKoss{} also provided the materials. 
So in a sense, the glaive was a gift from \NerrhanKoss. 

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{

\target{Ishnaruchaefir takes the name Nierzshah}
Armed with new Gnosis and power from the \xss, \Ishnaruchaefir took a new name:
\quo{\Nierzshah}, meaning \quo{Destroyer}.
At this point he had already been known by the title \quo{Destroyer} by \resphain and \dragons alike because of his fierceness in battle. 

It was a dark and terrible name, full of destructive power and ferocity and malice.

\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir became psycho-badass}
Armed with the glaive, the gifts of dark \NerrhanKoss and his new terrible name, \Ishnaruchaefir{} was suddenly so psycho-badass you would not believe it. 
\NerrhanKoss{} had taught him how to unlock and unleash even more \xsic{} \shaeeroth{} power, so \Ishnaruchaefir{} had \trope{TookALevelInBadass}{Gained a Level in Badass}. 

Compare to Aenarion in \cite{RPG:Warhammer:HighElves}, who becomes \uber-powerful after he draws the forbidden and evil Sword of Khaine. 

\citeauthorbook{RPG:Warhammer:HighElves}{Andy Chambers et al}{High Elves}{
  Aenarion returned to the fray and carried everything before him. 
  The power of the sword was so great that nothing could stand against him.
  It filled his enemies with terror and his own troops with unshakeable faith and unquenchable blood lust. 
  The followers of Aenarion became ever more brutal, cruel and merciless, lost in a dream of endless slaughter. 
  With each victory they became ever more heedless of their fate, they fought with no thought for their own lives, possessed by a desire to spill the blood of their enemies. 
  All the Elf warriors became heedless of danger and most heedless of them all was Aenarion. 
  
  Old longings, deeply buried in the Elf soul began to stir, and a darkness of the spirit descended on their armies. 
  There were those who fought for the joy of fighting and those who slew for the sake of slaying. 
  Aenarion carved himself out a new kingdom in northern Ulthuan, in the bleak land of Nagarythe, a place that mirrored his own dismal mood. 
  Many of the most savage Elf warriors were drawn here. 
  
  [\ldots{}]
  
  The war reached its final stage, an unequal contest of might between the Elves and the innumerable legions of the four Chaos powers. 
  Touched by Asuryan and marked by Khaine, Aenarion was an all but invincible warriors, a child of darkness and light. 
  His blade lent him power beyond mortal reckoning; the eternal flame gave him the strength to use it. 
  In battle, Aenarion slew foes beyond reckoning. 
  His loyal mount Indraugnir was a match for any Daemon. 
  And yet there was only one Aenarion, and the number of his followers was finite.

This piece contained some of the \hr{Fragments of Nexagglachel}{\Nexagglachel{} fragment} inside \Nathrach. 
From eating this, \Ishnaruchaefir{} \hr{Ishnaruchaefir understands the curse}{inherited a certain intuitive understanding} of \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse} and the psychology of the \satharioth. 





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir attacks \Nyx}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir devastates Nyx}
\Ishnaruchaefir led an incursion into \Nyx. 
As retribution for the \resphain's crimes, he and his brethren unleashed the destructive power of the \xss upon the \resphan homeworld. 
This slaughtered countless thousands of \resphain and millions of mortals and turned \Nyx into a blackened ruin. 
\Nyx would never recover from this blow. 





\subsubsection{\Resphain{} strike back}
With his newfound power, \Ishnaruchaefir{} pushed back the \resphain.
But they were not done. 
They devised counter-plans and again turned the tide of the war in their favour. 

So the \dragons{} had to take \emph{new} drastic measures. 
They began to plan the \hr{Shrouding}{\SecondShrouding}, which consisted of letting the \xss{} rape the foundations of the world. 









\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir and \Azraid}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir and Azraid develop empathy}
\Ishnaruchaefir and \Azraid met a few times. 
They secretly developed a faint empathy of sorts.
\Ishnaruchaefir had heard from \Nexagglachel that \hr{Ishnaruchaefir learns Azraid is on the level}{\Azraid was on the level}. 

\Ishnaruchaefir had some suspicion that \Azraid had more up his sleeve than he let on, and that he had plans for \Miith different from those of the \banelords.
He suspected that \Azraid had a hand in the \Shrouding, although \Azraid did not allow himself to be seen. 

Later the two would \hr{Ishnaruchaefir and Azraid plot together, early in TBW}{begin to plot together in ernest}. 









\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir asks \Zaz and \Urzaz}
\target{Zaz denies Ishnaruchaefir}
At some point (perhaps here, perhaps earlier or later), \Ishnaruchaefir appealed to the mysterious pair \hr{Zaz}{\Zaz and \Urzaz}. 
He asked them for aid. 

They denied him and punished him.
He was wounded and weakened by their attack.

Compare to \bandsong{Bal-Sagoth}{The Hound of Chaos Transcends the Barricades of Z'xulth}.














\section{The \SecondShrouding (\yds{Shrouding})}
\target{Shrouding}
\subsection{The \SecondShrouding{} is prepared}
The \dragons{} come up with the \SecondShrouding{} as a means to banishing the \banelords{} from \Miith{} and ending the war.
%The \secondbanewar{} ends with the \SecondShrouding{}. 





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} advocates the Shrouding}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir and the Shrouding}
There is dissension among the \dragons{} about whether this Shrouding plot is a good idea. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} was an advocate of the Shrouding plan. 
He had secretly negotiated with some \resphan{} lords who were planning to betray the \banes. 
That was why he was so fond of the Shrouding plan: 
He had invested a lot in it. 
(Arguably this was a case of the Down Funds Fallacy.)

(He would later go on to become one of the prime architects behind the \hs{Lie Sublime} and the \hr{Charade}{\charade}, too.) 





\subsubsection{The balance of the \matrices}
\target{Balance of the Matrices}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} still remembered his dreadful visions of a bloody future of eternal war. He conferred again with the wise elder \ophidians, \nagae{} and perhaps other creatures (such as the \hs{cosmic gods}). 
They tell him that the two \matrices{} are closely balanced, and that it is this unholy balance that keeps the war going, and will continue to do so. 
Tremendous \vertex{} power will be needed to shatter this balance, and this is not likely to happen for many thousands of years. 

This is a subversion of the trope \trope{BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil}{Balance Between Good and Evil}.

And so, the way \Ishnaruchaefir{} saw it, if the war could not be won or stopped, then it could at least be contained, made milder. He believed in the \charade{} project, because he saw it as a means of creating a peaceful world. That way, the great war between \dragons{} and \banes{} would be contained, and they would have to resort to stealth, instead of rampaging freely and laying waste to the world. 





\subsubsection{Three futures}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir sees three futures}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir chooses eternal war}
A revision: 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} did not see only one future, but three: 
Chaos, Darkness or eternal war. 
The two first were too horrible to contemplate, so he chose the third. 

The above is not strictly correct. 
The gods did not see three futures. 
They saw a myriad number of futures. 
But in most of them, \Miith{} was dominated by one of three tendencies. 

The gods should \hr{XS speech}{speak weird}.

\index{weaving artifact}
In order to effect the Shrouding, the \dragons{} used powerful magical items in the weaving. 
These became known as the \quo{Fulcra}, or \quo{weaving artifacts}. 
One such was \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} \hs{glaive}. 

These Fulcra are item-shaped \vertices{} that hold the Shroud in place.

  the sceptre, the sword, and the ring.
}





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} needs \ps{\Secherdamon} Gnosis}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir steals Secherdamon's research}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} needed to contact \hr{Naath-Kur-Ramalech}{\NaathKurRamalech}, the most important of the \xss{} that partook in the forging of the \hr{Crystal Sphere}{\CrystalSphere}. 
In order to do that, he needed some more Gnosis about the \ps{\xss} Aenigmata. 

He knew that \hr{Secherdamon seeks Gnosis}{\Secherdamon{} had done lots of research in this field}, so he sought him out. 
After some persuasion (and emotional blackmail invoking \ps{\Nexagglachel} dying wishes), \Secherdamon{} agreed to \cooperate. 
So he put all his research at his brother's disposal. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} stood on \ps{\Secherdamon} shoulders, and with a little help from the cosmic gods he achieved a flash of insight, granting him the Gnosis he needed. 
But he did not pass this knowledge on to \Secherdamon. 
At first \Ishnaruchaefir{} excused himself by saying that there was no time to teach \Secherdamon{} the very complex revelations he had seen.
\Secherdamon{} accepted this explanation, but expected \Ishnaruchaefir{} to tell him everything as soon as he was able. 

In truth, \Ishnaruchaefir{} was reluctant to tell \Secherdamon{} anything. 
He did not want to share the burden of \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's stewardship}{stewardship}, and he was already now getting paranoid.
Later, he would \hr{Ishnaruchaefir refuses to tell Secherdamon Gnosis}{outright refuse to tell \Secherdamon}. 





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} alienated}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} was bad at cooperating with his brethren. 
Numerous factors conspired to drive him apart from them: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    He felt guilt over having caused \ps{\Nexagglachel} death. 
    He should have died in his stead. 
  \item 
    \index{stewardship}
    He had \hr{Ishnaruchaefir gains stewardship}{promised \Nexagglachel{} to carry the burden of leadership}. 
    He was \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's stewardship}{unwilling to share that load}. 
  \item 
    Other \dragons{} accused him of being a coward and a weakling, having abandoned \Nexagglachel{} to his fate, leaving a far better \dragon{} to perish in his stead. 
    He failed to grab his obvious chances to save \Nexagglachel, they felt. 
    \Ishnaruchaefir{} partially agreed, but he refused to show any weakness and acknowledge any guilt. 
    This made the discussions turn nasty. 
  \item 
    There was a deepening chasm between him and \Secherdamon. 
    Both wanted to inherit \ps{\Nexagglachel} place. 
    They disagreed on how to lead their people, how to wage the war and how to carry on the legacies of \Nexagglachel{} and \Kserasshana. 
  \item 
    He argued with \Rystessakhin{}. 
    They had different plans to defeat the \resphain. 
    They were driven apart by their disagreements. 
\end{enumerate}

\Ishnaruchaefir{} became alienated from his \draconic{} brethren. 
He convinced himself that it was a futile effort to attempt to unite them behind him and make them see the wisdom of his actions. 
He could not trust his fellow \dragons. 
He was better off alone, walking his own path and trusting himself only, whatever others may think of him. 
So he took it upon himself to do as much as he could on his own. 
He did not rely on the input and expertise of others.
This meant that the \SecondShrouding{} ended up being much bloodier than it needed to be. 
It killed more \dragons{} and others and laid waste to more Realms than it needed. 
It was crude and rushed work. 
If they had all worked together, they could have found a cheaper, better, more effective solution. 
But that was not to be. 
Everyone's pride and other negative emotions prevented it. 
It was quite the tragedy. 

He decided to carry his burden alone and in silence. 
He had become disillusioned and now refused to \cooperate.
His fellow \dragons{} had become a burden and an obstacle. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Citizen}{
  I preach not for understanding.\\
  In you I have no faith.\\
  I spit at you my truth;\\
  that you are the burden of my heritage.
}

But in a way it was nothing new to him. 
It was in his nature to walk alone. 
He was used to trust himself and not depend on others. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:angL}{Ihsahn}{Monolith}{
  It was never\\
  the icy winds of the heights,\\
  but the coldness of the world\\
  that hardened my foundation.

}

He saw himself as called to a higher purpose, one that lesser beings (even other \dragons) could not understand. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:angL}{Ihsahn}{Monolith}{
  If my soaring presence\\
  threatens to break your neck,\\
  then so be it.\\

}

He accepted that others would not understand and love him.

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:angL}{Ihsahn}{Monolith}{
  There is a fundamental cleft\\
  between your world and mine.\\
  One of divine origin.
}

He felt the others were hypocrites who would never realize that he was right and they were wrong. 
(He would later revise this view a little bit, after realizing the depths of depravity to which he himself could sink.)

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:angL}{Ihsahn}{Monolith}{

\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} kept Gnosis to himself}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir refuses to tell Secherdamon Gnosis}
After the \SecondShrouding{} was complete, \Secherdamon{} still felt \Ishnaruchaefir{} was obligated to teach him the Gnosis that he had achieved by using \ps{\Secherdamon} research. 
But \Ishnaruchaefir{} refused. 
He did not trust \Secherdamon. 
They had grown to dislike and distrust each other during the infighting in the war. 

\hr{Secherdamon becomes better when denied Gnosis}{\Secherdamon{} grew bitter}. 





\subsubsection{\Secherdamon{} takes over}
After \Ishnaruchaefir{} went his own ways, \Secherdamon{} tried to take over and fill the empty position of leader. 
He tried to pick up the pieces after \Ishnaruchaefir{} abandoned them and left them in chaos and ruins (at least, that was how \Secherdamon{} saw it). 

This was hard work. 
It was one of the reasons why he came to hate \Ishnaruchaefir. 









\subsection{\Satharioth betray the \banelords}
\target{Banishment of the Banelords}
\target{End of the Second Banewar}
\target{Satharioth betray Banes}
The war rages. 

At the time of the \secondbanewar, the \dragons{} were weakened by internal warfare, so the \resphain{} had the upper hand for a while. 

But they crumbled when the \satharioth{} decided to betray the \banes.
%In the end, everyone loses, but especially the \banes. They were secretly backstabbed by the \satharioth{}. 
\hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse} overcame them, and so, poisoned with hatred of their creators, they decided that they desired overlordship for themselves and were unwilling to defer to their \bane{} masters after all. 

So the \satharioth{} secretly supported the \SecondShrouding{}. 
They allowed the \dragons{} to perform their Shrouding spells and even did some of their own. 
They also supported the \dragons{} with knowledge gleaned from the \hr{Shroud of Nyx}{Shroud of \Nyx}, which \Daggerrain{} had woven at the \hr{Thanatzil dies}{fall of \Thanatzil}. 

\Azraid{} secretly masterminded this deceit, but he did it so masterfully that no one suspected him. 
All the people who knew were quickly killed and their souls destroyed. 

The \satharioth also plotted against one another. 
\Netzachirah and Ramiel and \Azraid had come to hate \Morcariel, so they betrayed him and \hr{Morcariel dies}{let \Secherdamon destroy him}. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Origin}{

It remains unknown to what extent the \banes{} know of this treachery\dash certainly no \resphan{} dares bring it up with a \banelord. 









\subsection{\Secherdamon defeats \Morcariel}
\target{Morcariel dies}
By treachery \Secherdamon out\manoeuvred \Morcariel and forced him to fight. 
\Morcariel (with his bodyguards) braced himself for what he thought would be a fair fight and a heroic last stand. 

\Secherdamon:
\talk{Nay, \Morcariel.
  This will not be a fair fight.
  I have tricked thee.}

\Secherdamon took \Morcariel captive. 
He enslaved his soul and tortured \Morcariel forever after, as punishment for his horrible crimes against \dragonkind. 









\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir and \Rystessakhin}





\subsubsection{\Rystessakhin opposes \Ishnaruchaefir}
But \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} true love, \hr{Rystessakhin}{\Triestessakhin}, mother of \hr{Nzessuacrith}{\Nzessuacrith} and the \dragon{} closest to him in his life, railed against the plan. 
She saw the Lie Sublime, the perpetual and brutal oppression and the thousand-year-long underground war as a horrible dystopia and insisted that a better solution must be found to destroy the \banes. 
(Compare her to Latra Posae from \cite{RobertJordan:WorldofWOT}.) 
They debated and fought heatedly over this issue, and it drove them apart. 

\ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} vision of the Shrouding was bloody. 
Millions would have to die, and entire Realms might perish. 
\Rystessakhin{} did not like it. 
She felt nothing was worth the terrible cost that \Ishnaruchaefir{} proposed. 
She could not accept the idea of so callously throwing away millions and lives and devastating entire Realms. 
It would be a worse atrocity than the war itself. 

\Rystessakhin{} had a more peaceful, more tree-hugging plan. 
I don't know what exactly, but it should be something that sort of invokes \trope{ThePowerOfLove}{The Power of Love}. 
But without making her stupidly \trope{GenreBlind}{Genre Blind}. 
Anyway, the point is that \Ishnaruchaefir{} does not believe in her plan. 
He believes that only his own, more ruthless plan has a chance of success, because the world is like that. 
Ruthless. 

\ps{\Rystessakhin} plan \emph{could} work. 
He admitted that. 
But he didn't like the odds. 
Moreover, her plan involved her risking her own life and soul, becoming a \trope{BarrierMaiden}{Barrier Maiden} of sorts. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} would not accept that. 
He did not want to risk losing her.
He would sacrifice everyone else on Mith before he saw that happen. 
He felt that his plan was safer, and therefore well worth the cost in blood. 

Another point of contention was that \ps{\Rystessakhin} plan put her in great personal danger. 
She was prepared to sacrifice her life and soul. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} felt that \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's stewardship}{the salvation of \Miith{} was \emph{his} burden} and \emph{his alone}. 
He did not want \Rystessakhin{} to pay the price in his stead. 
If he let her do that, he would feel he had failed \Nexagglachel, her, himself and everyone. 
He wanted to bear the burden alone. 
His pride demanded no less. 
(But it was OK to let others die in the process. 
His principles were somewhat strange in that regard.)

\target{Ishna slays his beloved}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir slays his beloved}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir kills Rystessakhin}
Ultimately, \Rystessakhin{} somehow managed to stand in the way and block them, preventing \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} faction from initiating the Shrouding. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} confronted her and attempted one last time to reason with her. 
They failed to come to an agreement, and he had to admit\dash to himself, and to her\dash that he loved his vision more than he loved her. 

\Ishnaruchaefir needed a sacrifice to complete his spell. 
\Rystessakhin knew that, so she made sure to fuck his plan up.
There was no one else around, and time was running out. 
That was what \Rystessakhin meant when she said she would stop him with her life.
She was certain he would not kill her. 

She was wrong. 

\begin{prose}
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{Aeocrith.}
  
  \Rystessakhin:

  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{Curse thee, Aeocrith. I must! Canst thou not see?}
  
  \Rystessakhin: 
  \ta{Aye, I see very clearly.
    That which thou hast planned is an abomination.
    An atrocity.}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{It is the only way. Let me pass.}
  
  \Rystessakhin: 
  \ta{I will not let thee do this thing.
    Not now, not ever.
    Thou shalt not pass, lest thou go through me.}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{Curse thee! I have to save us all!}
  
  \Rystessakhin: 
  \ta{Thou wouldst damn us all, Quessanth.
    I know what thou intendest.
    It is too vile to consider.}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{It is the only solution left.}
  
  \Rystessakhin: 
  \ta{The price is too high!
    I will stop this madness, with my life if need be.
    Listen to reason, Quessanth!
    We fight the resphain because they are ravagers and destroyers of worlds.
    If we do this thing, we would be as wicked as they.
    Wilt thou have us become destroyers of worlds in their image, Quessanth?}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{If it would save our people?
    Aye.
    I would.}
  
  \Rystessakhin: 
  \ta{Nay, Quessanth.
    I will not let our race pay this price.
    I will not let our race bear this burden.
    This crime.
    This evil!}
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir: 
  \ta{So be it.
    If, as thou sayest, our race must not bear this evil... then they shall not.
    I will bear it.}
\end{prose}


\Ishnaruchaefir was desperate.
He knew time was running out.
He had to act now.
\Rystessakhin's refusal to see reason was making him furious.
She had ruined all other options.

\Ishnaruchaefir could not fail. 
He had a duty to \Nexagglachel.
He had failed him once before (when \Nexagglachel got captured instead of him). 
He was willing to pay \emph{any} price in order to not fail \Nexagglachel again. 

Just before this, \Ishnaruchaefir had sworn an oath not to back down no matter what. 
No matter the cost to him or to anyone else. 

He could sacrifice himself, but no. 
He needed to be alive to maintain the spell and mop up afterwards. 
He had to stay alive. 
There were no other sacrifices available. 
There was only \Rystessakhin. 

And so, at last, he slew her, striking her down with his glaive.

This scene needs to be heartbreaking. 
Compare to the scene in \cite{PhillipPullman:TheAmberSpyglass} where Lyra leaves Pantalaimon behind in order to travel to the realm of the dead. 

The \dragons \hr{True Draconic signifies emotion}{spoke \TrueDraconic out of emotion}. 

\begin{prose}
  \Ishnaruchaefir:
  \ta{Curse thee, \Aeocrith, stand aside!
    Or I swear by the \xss{} I shall strike thee down!}
  
  \Rystessakhin:
  \ta{
    Then strike me down, \Quessanth, for I will not let thee do this thing.}
\end{prose}

At this point, \Ishnaruchaefir{} had already forged his powerful glaive and intended to use it as a \hs{weaving artifact}. 

He did not intend to destroy nor eat \ps{\Aeocrith} soul. 
Nor did he mean to bind her in the glaive. 
He just meant to kill her temporarily. 
Even that was a pretty big thing between lovers (roughly equal to a mortal man brutally beating up or raping his wife). 
That was her own doing. 
She knew the glaive was his weaving artifact, the instrument of his plan.





\subsubsection{Moments of destruction}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir destroys the world}
As he slew her, she latched onto the glaive and poured her soul into it. 
She realized that she could not stop him, so she wanted to help him and share his burden. 
She intended to sacrifice herself and make herself a permanent Barrier Maiden and help him uphold the Shroud. 
He tried to stop her and carry on with his own plan. 
He did not want her to pay the price in his stead. 
He would rather see millions of innocents die. 

He fought to stop her. 
But she insisted. 

Countless innocents died all over the realms in those precious seconds where he struggled against her (she was, after all, sacrificing herself to save those people). 

And it got worse. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} raged inside at the injustice of it. 
He realized \Rystessakhin{} would sacrifice her soul and so be lost to him, and try as he might he could not prevent it. 

\begin{prose}
  \tho{%
    Without \Nexagglachel{} I am the greatest, the mightiest, the bravest, the noblest of all the \dzraicchenosses.
    I deserve better than this!
    I have worked and fought so hard and sacrificed so much for the world and the \psp{\dragons}{} sake. 
    I have wrung dry and depleted my standing and reputation. 
    And now I must lose my beloved!
    This is wrong!}
\end{prose}

Rationally, he knew better than to appeal to any \quo{justice}. 
He did not believe in such silliness. 
But at that moment he did not care. 
All the burning hot power of the \xss{} was coursing through his veins, and they filled his heart with volatile passion. 
His emotions blinded him and carried him away and took control of him. 
Only for a brief moment, but it was a brutal, costly moment. 
In his fury he lashed out against the world.
Millions died across the Realms of \Miith{} in that moment to sate his anger. 

He released all his anger. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Invocation}{
  Come suffering, Apocalypse.\\
  Release the fires of Hell.\\
  I call upon destruction and despair.\\
  Here the days of slumber end.\\
  I beckon the night \\
  to live and overcome the fear.
}

By now he knew he would be hated forever for his actions. 
And in that moment the world could go fuck itself for all he cared. 
So he might as well make it worse. 

\citebandsong{Ihsahn:TheAdversary}{Ihsahn}{Invocation}{

He released, and gave into, his inner evil. 
Part of it was his \xs-born destructive urges.

}

In these moments of destruction, a tremendous struggle and a tremendous character development took place inside \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} head. 
He gained much insight into his own Aenigma.

}

At last he realized that his struggling was pointless and only demeaned her noble sacrifice (by aggravating the destruction she fought to prevent), so he relented and let her do her thing. 
She poured all her soul into the glaive, where it would \hr{Rystessakhin's consciousness}{become crippled and never again regain consciousness}. 

\index{stewardship}
He was not happy about it. 
He felt like he had failed in \hr{Ishnaruchaefir's stewardship}{his task}.
\emph{He} should be the one carring \ps{\Miith} safety on his shoulders. 
Not she. 
Never her. 
It was wrong that she should suffer like this. 
(He didn't mind condemning many others to suffering, and was even willing to kill her, but \quo{that was different}. 
His motivations need not be entirely consistent.) 

But he never told this story to the world. 
They all thought he killed her and bound her soul against her will. 
For \Ishnaruchaefir, to admit the truth would be a declaration of failure for more than once reason:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    He would be admitting he had failed in the task entrusted to him by \Nexagglachel, which he had previously been so obsessive about.
  \item 
    He would appear to have been too weak to bear the great sacrifice alone. 
    This would harm his \hr{Myths about Ishnaruchaefir}{mythical reputation} as an invincible superbeing. 
    He likes that reputation. 
    It makes people fear him. 
  \item 
    He would look like he was apologizing for his mistake and seeking forgiveness. 
\end{enumerate}

His pride allows him to do neither. 
Only \Criseis-tachi knew the truth. 
And he made them promise not to reveal the story to anyone. 
(By the time of the \thirdbanewar, the accepted story was so ingrained that if \Criseis-tachi had tried to spread the true story, no one would have believed them.)


Mourning what he had done, he resolved to honour her sacrifice. 
From that day he would keep the glaive safe and always carry it with him. 
He went on to use the glaive as his \hs{weaving artifact} as he and his fellows wove the \hr{Shrouding}{\SecondShrouding}. 

He remains to this day one of the pivotal \vertices{} keeping the Shroud in place.

But slaying his beloved was traumatic and became a turning point in his life. It distanced him further from Chaos, the \firstgendragons{} and his fellow \dragons.

\Ishnaruchaefir{} contemplates his betrayal. 

\lyricsbs{Vital Remains}{Scorned}{
  So be it. I am the enemy.\\
  So be it. I am the one you seek.\\
  So be it. I have no sympathy or empathy.\\
  It is done. My words and life bleed blasphemy.
}









\subsection{The \SecondShrouding}
The \SecondShrouding{} was complete. 





\subsubsection{The cost of the Shrouding}
The \SecondShrouding{} was an incredibly costly and bloody affair. 
Millions of souls had to perish so that their vital cores and energies could be consumed and used to feed the nascent Shroud. 
This sacrifice would destroy entire Realms, bleed them dry and lifeless. 
It was a cosmic violation that left Mother \Miith{} wounded and bleeding and suffering for millennia to come. 

These souls still exist, bound in the Shroud. 
They retain a minimum of consciousness, enough to weep and suffer. 

The weaving artifacts each bind a very powerful soul, thus acting as \vertices{} in the \matrix{} that is the Shroud. \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} glaive, for instance, holds the soul of \Triestessakhin. 

The ones weaving the Shroud needed to siphon and sap the emotions of the people they sacrificed. 

\lyricslimbonicart{Deathtrip to a Mirage Asylum}{
  Cut the string, the chain to soil.\\
  Unleash the powers within death's coil.\\
  No darker emotion is there to find\\
  than the fading feeling of a dying kind.
  
  Deathtrip to a mirage asylum.
}





\subsubsection{Why was it worse than last time?}
Why was it so much worse than the forging of the \hr{Crystal Sphere}{\CrystalSphere}, also a humongous cosmic upheaval? 
Probably because the \banes{} were closer this time and had more of their tendrils firmly secured on \Miithian{} soil. 
And they were advancing rapidly. 
And they had learned from their mistakes from last time and would not be so easily outwitted again. 

The \dragons{} had to act swiftly and desperately. 
Besides, they were not nearly as unified as they were last time (under \Kserasshana). 
This also weakened them. 
In the end, \QuessanthIshnaruchaefir{} acted virtually alone, against the world. 
So his Shrouding could not help but be a messy hackjob. 





\subsubsection{Entire Realms destroyed}
The price of the \SecondShrouding{} was extremely bloody. 
Entire sub-Realms of \Miith{} were laid waste, sucked dry of life in order to feed the Shroud. 
Actually, the \SecondShrouding{} itself might have caused \emph{more} destruction than the entire \secondbanewar{} had caused (up till that time, that is).

The world is violently torn apart and laid waste by the terrible destruction. 

\lyricsbible{Revelations 8:7}{
  And there followed hail and fire with blood, \\
  and they were cast upon the earth.\\
  And the third part of trees was burnt up, \\
  and all the green grass was burnt up.\\
  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.\\
  And the third part of the waters became wormwood.\\
  And many men died of the waters,\\
  because they were made bitter.
}

Especially the \resphan{} cities in \Nyx{} are hit hard by this. 
They lose the flow of \bane{} power from \Erebos{} on which they had previously relied. 
Now the entire Realm of \Nyx{} must sustain itself by leeching off of the other \Miithian{} Realms. 
The vast, splendid cities of \Nyx{} (only recently cleaned up from the bloodshed of the \Merkyran{} war) crumble and become a dead necropolis. 

\lyricsbs{Monolith Deathcult}{Concrete Sarcophagus}{
  In this gargantuan tumour,\\
  the choice had already been made.
  
  A thousand tons of steel and cement\\
  dispersed like a cancerous cough.
  
  Attending their fall-out funeral, this monstrous colossus.\\
  Radiating cancer for generations to come.\\
  20,000 tonnes of steel and cement\\
  cover the tumourous spider.\\
  Awaiting her next victims.\\
  The Concrete Sarcophagus.
}

\lyricsbible{Revelations 8:7}{
  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.\\
  And the third part of the waters became wormwood.\\
  And many men died of the waters,
  because they were made bitter\\
}





\subsubsection{It is temporary}
Someone (maybe \Ishnaruchaefir) remarks that a new age has begun.
An age of the Shroud. 
But he knows how destructive and constricting the Shroud is.
It will not last. 
It will push the world towards some climax, until finally all hell will break loose. 
The Shroud will one day be lifted again, and \Miith will be free\ldots{} or \Miith will be destroyed. 









\subsection{\Secherdamon curses his enemies}
After the \secondbanewar, \Secherdamon planned his revenge against the \resphain (and \Ishnaruchaefir, for that matter):

\citebandsong{Nile:FestivalsofAtonement}{Nile}{

\chapter{\ResphanWarsBook}
\section{The \Dragons}
\subsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} and \Secherdamon{} split}
After the \hr{Fall of Nexagglachel}{fall of \Nexagglachel}, \Ishnaruchaefir{} and \Secherdamon{} had a falling out and went their separate ways. 

\Secherdamon{} was obsessed with Chaos, the \xzaishanns{} and the \firstgendragons. 

\Ishnaruchaefir, on the other hand, did research on the Darkness and the origin and nature of the \bane{} and \resphan{} peoples. He had lots of \hr{Ishnaruchaefir and Baelzerach}{dealings with the \Baelzerach} and learned much of the Darkness from them. 

This is one of the reasons why he became so dark. 

\lyricstitle{Zeratul from \cite{VideoGame:Starcraft}}{
  You speak of knowledge, Judicator. 
  You speak of experience. 
  I have journeyed through the darkness between the most distant stars. 
  I have beheld the births of Negative Suns and borne witness to the entropy of entire realities. 
  Unto my experience, Aldaris, all that you have built here on Aiur is but a fleeting dream. 
  A dream from which your precious Conclave will awaken, to find themselves drowned in a greater nightmare.
}





\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} absent}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} left \Miith{} and took no part in the \resphanwars. 

As such, he \emph{does not appear} in this book, unless there are scenes taking place in the Mirage Asylum and other exotic places. 






\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} resented for leaving}
Many \dragons, not only \Secherdamon, resented \Ishnaruchaefir{} for leaving and \quo{abandoning} his people.
They felt he should have stayed when his people needed him and taken on the role of leader in \ps{\Nexagglachel} stead. 
But \Ishnaruchaefir{} did not feel up to the task. 
And he needed time away from everyone after the \SecondShrouding, which was traumatic for him. 









\subsection{\ps{\Secherdamon} rise to power}
\target{Secherdamon's rise to power}
After the \hr{Death of Nexagglachel}{death of \Nexagglachel} and the great \secondbanewar, \HriistD{} burned with ambition, and with his determination, ruthlessness and cunning he quickly rose to power in the \draconic{} hierarchy (to the extend that a such existed).

After cursing \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} treachery, \Secherdamon{} decided that the aftermath of the \secondbanewar{} was his great chance. 
He was happy that \Ishnaruchaefir{} had had the decency to run away. 
In \ps{\Secherdamon} mind, his self-important brother very much deserved to fall from grace, after trying to set himself up as \dragonlord. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:Prometheus}{Emperor}{He Who Sought the Fire}{
  Towards the heavens he did aspire.\\
  Now he shall burn who sought the fire.
}

\Secherdamon{} will not mourn. 
He will seize his chance. 
His time for greatness has come. 

\citebandsong{Emperor:Prometheus}{Emperor}{He Who Sought the Fire}{
  Some will mourn the ashes cold,\\
  while others behold the inferno unfold.
  
  Now he shall burn who sought the fire,\\
  to manifest another.
}


This left \Secherdamon{} as one of the mightiest \dragons{} around. 

I need to tell a detailed back story with \Secherdamon{} as the protagonist. 
He has flaws, but rises above them. 
We see the adversity he faces, and his determination and courage, and we love him. 
Compare him to Zurra from \bandalbum{Bal-Sagoth}{The Power Cosmic}, but sympathetic.

In order to claim the mystic power that he coveted, he needed  knowledge and artifacts. 
These he took by force and treachery, waging war and slaying his fellow \dragons{} and \ophidian{} to obtain what he needed.





\subsubsection{Motivation}
He finds his motivation and grows strong of will.

\lyricsbalsagoth{Arcana Antediluvia}{
And so it was written \\
that rage would carry him like a howling wind, \\
leaving only frozen corpses,\\
their bones rattling in hollow armour, \\
to tell their tale in his wake.
}

He wants to restore the \dragons{} to their rightful position of overlordship. 

\lyricsbs{Hate Eternal}{King of All Kings}{
  As I am I reclaim the throne of all creation. \\
  As I shall be annointed king. \\
  For thy strength I must sustain.\\
  For thy dominion I shall proclaim.
}





\subsubsection{Seeking allies}
He slew other \dragons, including those mightier than he, and somehow stole their \vertex{} power by necromancy. 
Compare this to the power of Boris Dragosani in \authorbook{Brian Lumley}{Necroscope}.

\target{Secherdamon sacrifices Dragons}
He did not \hr{soul-eating}{devour their souls}, because \hr{Dragons do not eat Dragons}{that would be taboo}. 
But he sacrificed their souls to the \xss. 
Perhaps the \xss{} then granted him their \vertex{} power. 

He also seeks out allies. He wants old and powerful \dragons{} and \ophidians{} to help him. One especially great and powerful one rejects him. They fight, and \Secherdamon{} loses. But later he returns and exacts his revenge. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Callisto Rising}{
  [ZURANTHUS:]\\
  Do not seek to threaten me, wormcast.\\
  My tenure here is preordained\ldots{}\\
  and I will suffer your arrogance no longer, little brother.\\

}





\subsubsection{Stealing artifacts}
\target{Secherdamon steals weaving artifacts}
And he steals several \hs{weaving artifacts}, killing their original owners and usurping their power. 

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{Summoning the Guardians of the Astral Gate}{
  The incantation of Xuk'ul is known to me, \\
  the Orb of Summoning earned with bloodshed! \\

  And the central stone of the ancient ebon ring begins
  to pulsate with a darksome energy\ldots{}
}









\subsection{\Secherdamon{} becomes a \shaeeroth (\yds{Secherdamon becomes Shaeeroth})}
\target{Secherdamon becomes Shaeeroth}
\Secherdamon{} finally had the strength and desperate determination to cross the boundary and become a full-fledged \shaeeroth{} (\hr{Secherdamon does not become Shaeeroth}{unlike before}). 





\subsubsection{Invocation of power}
\target{Rissit invokes dark gods}
\HriistD{} performs a dark, occult ritual, summoning the \firstgendragons{}, \xzaishanns{} and cosmic gods (see section \ref{Cosmic gods}), seeking to gain their wisdom and power. 

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{
  As the Vortex Illumines the Crystalline Walls of Kor-Avul-Thaa

  By Klatrymadon and Zuranthus, \\
  the vortex blackens the stars above.\\
  A vast plague of amorphous horrors \\
  descends to rend with fang and talon.
}





\subsubsection{Calling upon dark powers}
He calls upon the ancient \ophidian{} lords, who are primordial natural forces and dormant rulers of \Miith{}.

\lyricsbalsagoth{
  Into the Silent Chambers of the Sapphirean Throne (Sagas from the Antediluvian Scrolls)
}{
  Winged dragon coiled in thrice,\\
  bane of flame in shadowed ice.
  Flooded by the bloated Moon,\\

}

He invokes dark names.

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{

}{

  Ring of elder stones entwined in prophecy,\\
  the Rite of Invocation enthralls thine power.
  
  Lucent beams lancing forth from gleaming Cepheid stars.\\
  A creeping mist ensorcels my tongue\ldots{}
}





\subsubsection{Obtaining power}
He is granted power far greater and more sinister than ever before. 

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{
  Summoning the Guardians of the Astral Gate
}{
  Replete from drinking deep of darkness\ldots{}
}

He becomes almost a \quo{\Tiamat{} junior}. He summons hordes\dash or entire races\dash of \mdaemons{} to serve him.

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{
  Summoning the Guardians of the Astral Gate
}{
  Black shapes dancing 'twixt the stars.
}





\subsubsection{Conquering his enemies}

He becomes powerful, so that even other \dragons{} fear him. He is spoken of in legends as a terrible force.

\lyricsbalsagoth{Arcana Antediluvia}{
  His gaze is as fire, \\
  his words are as spear-points, \\
  his voice is as thunder, \\
  his touch as the plague!
}

He seeks out his foes.

\lyricsbalsagoth{Arcana Antediluvia}{
  And one night, there came a storm, \\
  a storm with searing red winds.\\
  Fire and steel rode within it, \\
  and vengeance writ in thunder and blood.\\
}

He called down curses and spells of destruction upon his enemies.
See the section on \hr{Magic visuals}{magic visuals}, especially \hr{Curses of destruction visuals}{curses of destruction}.


He conquers and crushes his enemies, and it is at last his turn to laugh.

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Empyreal Lexicon}{
  Kur'oc! Gul-Kor! \\

  Begot of the thunder\ldots{} spellbinder. Callisto Rising!
  
  [ZURANTHUS:]\\
  Behold my godhood\ldots{} and pray!
}




\subsubsection{Sacrificing them for more power}
\Secherdamon rose to power in a way that \hr{Narkiza's rise to power}{would later be mirrored by \Narkiza}.
Not by eating his enemies directly, but by sacrificing them to the \xss and being granted power in return.
This amounted to the same thing, allowing him to dodge draconic taboos.
\Secherdamon remembered this similarity when he sponsored \Narkiza.

\citebandsong{Nile:InTheirDarkenesShrines}{Nile}{

}





\subsubsection{Death and rebirth}
\target{Rissit's death and rebirth}
In order to fully absorb his new power, \HriistD{} must die and be reborn. 
He is a son of the god of Death, after all. 

This is necessary to unlock his true potential as a son of Death. \Ishnaruchaefir{} went through a similar thing (see section \ref{Ishnaruchaefir's death and rebirth}), but \HriistD{} was initially to scared to do it. 

This is kind of a darker, more evil version of the Babylonian myth of Ishtar's death and rebirth. 

Perhaps it is a theme that \Secherdamon{} was originally somewhat weak and cowardly, but later in life acquired the immense determination and ambition that let him become one of the mightiest creatures on \Miith{}. 





\subsubsection{Takes the name \Veldraxx}
\target{Secherdamon takes the name Veldraxx}
\Secherdamon took the \quo{\Veldraxx} as his \hr{Shaeeroth name}{\shaeeroth name}.





\subsubsection{Witnesses to the ritual}
\Nzessuacrith{} helps \Secherdamon{} from the beginning, being disappointed in her father for seeming cowardice and abandoning his people. She participates in his empowering ritual. 

Describe it in a flashback!

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{
  Summoning the Guardians of the Astral Gate

  A great stillness binds the moon-cloaked mountaintop in glooming shackles\ldots{} \\

  And the central stone of the ancient ebon ring begins to pulsate with a darksome energy\ldots{} \\
  A thunderous maelstrom ablaze with writhing celestially spawned power then rends the stygian night\ldots{} \\
  A vast shimmering aperture, a vortex of heliacal fire\ldots{} the pathway to beyond beckons!\\
  The Astral Gate is open\ldots{}\\
  The Guardians have awakened\ldots{}
}

Someone important (not \Ishnaruchaefir, though) watches from a distance and discusses the situation with someone. 







\subsection{\Secherdamon{} goes to war}
\Secherdamon{} goes to war wielding his new terrible powers.

\section{The \resphanwars}
\target{Resphan Wars}
\target{Resphan wars}
After the \secondbanewar, \resphain{} and \dragons{} alike fought on with all the spite they could muster\dash against each other, and internally. For thousands of years. Both sides had lost great leaders in the war and were now divided, left in chaos. Their civilizations declined. 









\subsection{Dynasties wage war}
\target{Dynasties split}
After the \hr{Shrouding}{\Shrouding}, the \banelords{} were locked out again. 
They now had little power over \Miithian{} affairs. 
They could still communicate, but only with difficulty. 

The \banelords{} were gruesome \trope{CosmicHorror}{Cosmic Horrors}, and the \resphain{} feared them. 
They feared and loathed \emph{contact} with the horrible \banes{} more than they feared the punishment that would be their \emph{if} the \banes{} were to one day return in force. 
Many \resphain, believing the \banelords{} were gone for good, ignored them and blocked them out and refused to obey their commands (\hr{Resphan cannibalism}{patricidal bastards that they were}). 

(Only the \banelords{} were gone. 
\Lesserbanes{} continued to serve the \resphain, but the \resphain{} never allowed them to evolve into \banelords.) 

Only few \resphain, like \hr{Azraid}{\Azraid}, remained \quo{loyal} to the \banelords. 

With the \banes{} and their leadership gone, the central organization of the \resphan{} empire crumbled.
The \resphain{} splintered into several dynasties and began to war amongst themselves. 
It was a big free-for-all. 

At first there was \hs{Cabal}. 
\hr{Cabal formed}{That came later}. 
There was no \quo{Cabal bloc}, and all dynasties had shifting alliances and enmities. 





\subsubsection{\Kezerad}
\Kezerad was not particularly the \quo{odd man out}. 
They sometimes allied with the other dynasties. 

\target{Tiphred-Serah and Kezerad ally}
The \TiphredSerah{}, being \hr{Tiphred-Serah free-thinking}{the most free-thinking of the dynasties}, were the ones most liable to ally with \Kezerad. 





\subsubsection{\Mystraacht}
\target{Mystraacht dominance during Resphan Wars}
For a long time during the \resphanwars, \Mystraacht{} was the most powerful of the dynasties. 
They had the most capable warriors and generals, but they were also \hr{Mystraacht not diplomatic}{the least diplomatic}. 

They relied on military power alone and eventually got many enemies against them. 
This was one of the things that \hr{Mystraacht betrayed}{felled them in the end}. 





\subsubsection{\TiphredSerah}
\target{TiphredSerah in the Resphan Wars}
In the beginning, the \TiphredSerah were doing good in the wars.
They were pragmatic and always ready to ally with whomever convenience dictated.
They rode the winds of fortune and were sneaky and opportunistic. 

But in the end this tactic backfired.
Eventually no one trusted the \TiphredSerah.
No one would ally with them for fear of being betrayed soon after. 
Everyone began to hate \TiphredSerah.

They lost some wars and lost many members.
After this, the kept a low profile. 
From now on, \TiphredSerah was one of the smallest dynasties. 
They would never recover. 









\subsection{The \satharioth{} try to break the curse but fail}
Time and time again the \satharioth{} try to break free of \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse}, but fail. 

\lyricslimbonicart{The Yawning Abyss of Madness}{
Again I drift the halls of wondering. \\
The black castle of solitude. \\

infest every cell. 

Internal ceremonies in ritual death. \\
External bleedings for the demon of madness. \\
Hide from the torture of the dazzling light. \\
The demolition voice shall speak tonight. 

While I'm staring down into the darkest pit, \\
an ocean black as the night, \\
so infinite deep and consuming, \\
it swallows all life force with might. 

Again I drift the halls of wondering, \\
as I focus for the darkness to come. \\
In anguish minds uplift the conquering \\

An abstract reality and bottomless insanity. \\
To search for the powers to please\\
the subconscious spirit of disease. \\
Time found no remedy, \\
cause winds of darkness was stealing me. 

The yawning abyss of madness. \\
A cryptic slaughter by hate. \\
Darkness is the only survivor \\
as evil dominion terminates. \\
The yawning abyss of madness.
}









\subsection{Mortal armies come into fashion}
Originally, the master races did not send armies of mortals into battle. That was not cost-effective, since mortals were nigh-worthless when pitted against the master races.  

But after the cataclysmic \secondbanewar, the \dragons{} and \resphain{} had become critically decimated, and it would take them many millennia to recover their numbers. Their slave races were also decimated, but they could be replenished far faster. So suddenly it began to pay off to raise armies of mortals for war. 

In the beginning, these mortals were outfitted with terrible \hr{technology}{high-tech weapons} and magic, but this turned out to be too dangerous, so after the adoption of the \hr{Charade}{\charade}, this practice was abolished. 









\subsection{\Sathariah{} bloodlines dominate}
The \resphan{} people saw three horrible wars: The rebellion, the \secondbanewar{} and the \resphanwars. 
%Many, many \resphain{} were slaughtered in the rebellion
All this bloody fighting wiped out most of the number. Above it all, the \satharioth{} stood victorious, with their allies and blood-kin at their side. 

Their houses and bloodlines came to dominate the \resphan{} race, and today most \resphain{} have some \sathariah{} blood in them. This makes \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse} all the more potent. 










\subsection[Mystraacht falls]{\Mystraacht{} falls (\yds{Zachirah death})}
\target{Mystraacht betrayed}
The \Mystraacht{} were the most adept among the dynasties at utilizing the power of \chaos{} and combining it with the \erebean{} power of the \banes. 
So they were the strongest, and none of the other \resphan{} kingdoms, nor even the \dragons, could stand against them. 
They might even have conquered the planet, were it not for treachery. 
For \hr{Zachirah}{\Zachirah}, the Overlord of \Mystraacht{}, was betrayed, by forces inside the dynasty as well as outside it, and he was assassinated.

\hr{Shiaraid's tragedy}{\ps{\Shiaraid} tragedy} was \NexagglachelsCurse, which forced her to destroy herself and those she loved. 
One person she loved was her father, \Zachirah. 

Somehow the Curse turned them against one another. 
She did not mean to, but her destructive impulses made her betray him and be instrumental in his downfall. 





\subsubsection{\Zachirah{} dies}
\target{Zachirah dies}
When \Zachirah{} was finally killed, he ordered his \hr{Zachirah's slave Resviel}{slave \resviel} to give him their life force to sustain him. 
They did so willingly, sacrificing their souls in the process. 
(Life drain is \hr{Voluntary drain}{more effective if it's willing}.)
But to no avail; he still died. 

When \Zachirah{} realized he was doomed, he cast a desperate spell that destroyed his soul, causing it to explode. 
He would rather destroy himself than let his enemies consume his remains. 

His enemies were shocked. 
\ta{Only a madman would destroy his own soul,} they thought. 
But some of them sensed a trace of \ps{\Nexagglachel} savage essence in \ps{\Zachirah} eyes in his last moments. 
They speculate if \hr{Curse}{\NexagglachelsCurse} played a part. 

Several princes now fought for the legendary Throne of \Mystraacht, but none was able to prevail. The dynasty crumbled in internal struggles for power and was diminished. 





\subsubsection{Ramiel defeated at sea}
\target{Ramiel defeated at sea}
Ramiel had a traumatic defeat in a naval battle which spelled the end of his career and spurred him on to \hr{Malach project}{become a \Malach}. 
It also gave him \hr{Ramiel fears the sea}{a fear of the sea}. 

\target{Ascaril destroyed}
During this ill-fated battle, Ramiel's sword, \hr{Ascaril}{\Ascaril}, is shattered and destroyed. 

Ramiel is killed, but only temporarily. 









\subsection{The \Malach{} Project (\yds{Malach fiasco})}
\target{Malach project}
The \Malach{} project started as a secret underground gathering of \resphain{} who were disgruntled with the dynasties. 
They had been dishonoured and felt betrayed. 
So they wanted to be \uber{} and show the others how great they were and how much glory they deserved, and thus claim their rightful places and power. 

The \banelords{} supported them. 

They envisioned the \Malach{} project. 
It was supposed to be the successor to the \sathariah{} project and transform them into super-powered \uber-\resphain. 





\subsubsection{\Azraid}
\target{Azraid masterminds Malachim}
Unbeknownst to all, \Azraid was monitoring the \malach project from the very beginning. 
He did not mastermind it, but he did influence it, and he had a good idea of what they were doing. 
For him, \hr{Azraid turns Malachim into Neo}{this research was a precursor} to his own \hr{Neo-Resphan}{\neoresphan} project. 

Later \Azraid \hr{Captive Malach}{captured a \malach} for research. 

Even later, he managed to \hr{Ramiel becomes Neo}{turn the awakened Ramiel into a \neoresphan}. 




\subsubsection{\Malach{} cannibalism}
\target{Cannibal Malachim}
\index{cannibalism!\Malachim}
Just as the \satharioth{} grew strong by consuming \Nexagglachel, 
the \malachim{} were to derive their power from stolen and subsumed \resphan{} souls. 
It had been known for a while that the \resphain{} were meant to devour others of their kind to survive and grow, but the \malach{} project aimed to take this to its utmost consequence. 
Each \malach{} was to become a walking \carcer, a deep well of souls, and of \emph{power}. 

To achieve this, they had to capture, kill and devour \emph{many} \resphain{}.
(They endeavoured to victimize their own enemies as much as they could.
Ramiel-tachi, after their fall-from-grace, had many such enemies.)
That is why the project had to be kept such a secret and operate underground.  
The dynasties would destroy them if they knew. 

They called down curses and spells of destruction upon their enemies and ate them.
See the section on \hr{Magic visuals}{magic visuals}, especially \hr{Curses of destruction visuals}{curses of destruction}.

The \malachim became powerful by eating their fellow \resphain.
In this they remained true to the spirit and purpose of the \resphan race. 
More so than their enemies, they boasted.

\subsubsection{It went wrong}
But someone had gotten word of their plan and wanted to thwart it. 
Sentinels and Cabalists alike infiltrated their group and fucked up the spells and research. 
\hr{Curse}{\ps{\Nexagglachel}{} ghost} also played a part (some of the prospective \malachim{} were \satharioth). 

% The spells were very expensive and difficult to carry out. 
% So instead of doing just one test run they decided to risk it and make several \malachim{} at once. 
% One of the \satharioth{} stepped up and claimed that he/she was not afraid and wanted to be part of the first batch. 
% This made the others fight over the remaining places. 
% So in the end, it was the most powerful ones that went first. 
% (Some also feared that if the weaker ones were transformed into \uber-powerful \malachim, they might strike back at their previously-more-powerful brethren and betray them when they had the chance, before the \satharioth{} could go through the ritual and surpass them again.)
At first, it seemed to go well. 
When he first \malachim{} came out on the other side, they had new and enhanced powers. 
Their new powers were erratic and difficult to control, but they had no reason to assume that this was anything but an issue of practice and experience. 

So they carried on and created more \malachim. 
One of the \satharioth{} stepped up and claimed that he/she was not afraid and wanted to be part of the first batch. 
This made the others fight over the remaining places. 
So in the end, it was the most powerful ones that went first. 
(Some also feared that if the weaker ones were transformed into \uber-powerful \malachim, they might strike back at their previously-more-powerful brethren and betray them when they had the chance, before the \satharioth{} could go through the ritual and surpass them again.)

Some days later, it started going wrong. 
The \malachim{} began to suffer from side effects. 
They were prone to amnesia, manic behaviour and disease. 
Gradually, over a course of days, they wasted away mentally and physically, until they died. 

The rest knew that the dead \malachim{} were not destroyed, but their souls had grown faint and Shrouded and were difficult to track. 
Later the remaining next-of-kin discovered that the \malachim{} were being reborn with amnesia as \humans{} (later called \hs{Scions}). 

There were many more who wanted to become \malachim, but sinced it went so wrong, the spell was never repeated. 
They did more research and tried to fix the flaws, but they did not succeed, so they soon abandoned the project and returned to their dynasties, defeated. 





\subsubsection{\Cishiel{} wanted to join}
\target{Cishiel wanted to be a Malach}
\hr{Cishiel}{\Cishiel} wanted to join the \malach{} project and be part of the first generation. 
But Ramiel forbade it. 
She was still a young girl, and his only heir. 
He did not want to see her put in harm's way. 

She was bitter. 
But after it all went wrong she had to admit that he was right. 

In the days when the \malachim{} were going mad, it was horrible for the young \Cishiel{} to witness her father, the mighty Ramiel, wasting away and degenerating into a maddened wretch. 
She was now very grateful that he had forbidden her to partake. 





\subsubsection{They lose their memory}
The \malachim{} lose their memory and descend into amnesia and madness. 
They feel great pain, anguish, sorrow and hate over this betrayal.

\section{Other races}
Remember that even though the period is often called \quo{the \resphanwars}, the \nagae, \aryothim{} and \vorcanths{} also played important roles.
