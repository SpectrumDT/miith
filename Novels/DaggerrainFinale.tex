\daggerrain{Glacier! Veskyr! Ennaxor! Attend me. We have much to do.}

\ta{Much to do?} Veskyr almost shrieked, incredulous. \ta{What is there to do? What can we do?}

\daggerrain{I have planned for this contingency. We have lost a battle...}

\ta{A battle? A BATTLE? Daggerrain, you are insane! We have lost the WAR! We have been utterly defeated! Nothing can possibly ---} 

Her ramblings were cut short as Daggerrain lashed out through \Nyx{} with a whip. Veskyr flew through the room, crashed into a wall and collapsed, unconscious. 

Daggerrain addressed the others in his usual, emotionless voice. \daggerrain{I have no time for those who despair. Now listen. We have lost a battle and must regroup before we can strike again.}

\ta{But Daggerrain,} Ennaxor interjected. \ta{How can we possibly strike again? Our forces have been obliterated. Do you have some secret weapon.}

\daggerrain{No secret, only the same weapon I have always employed: patience. Contrary to what you believe --- and what the Dragons believe --- we are not destroyed. The Cabal still exists. I have planned for this contingency. There is another conjunction in two thousand and four hundred years, and I intend to be ready for it.}
%I have fought the Dragons for twenty thousand years already; what matter two thousand more? 

\daggerrain{Now listen carefully...}
