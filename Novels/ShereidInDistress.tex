\section{Shereid in distress}
\thought{What is happening to me?} wailed Shereid to herself. \thought{What madness has come over me? I tell myself it is nothing, yet whenever he is near I find myself simpering, crawling at his feet.}

She gripped her family dagger tight. \thought{I have always been strong. Never have I let myself dominate by a man. Oh, I have let them dominate me physically, but that was never true submission. I have always been in control. I have been strong.} Her eyes went to the eagle symbol on the dagger. \thought{Free... I have always been free. But now...}

She clutched the dagger, wringing her hands on it, pressing it to her forehead as if swearing an oath upon it. \thought{Strong. Free. In control. Yes. By the \Kliffoth{}, I am a Seducer. I manipulate men, bend them to my will, in a time, place and manner of \emph{my} choosing! This is me. This is Shereid of Clan Geican. But with \emph{him}... with Carzain... I feel myself losing control.}

(Praying to the \Sephiroth{}.) 

Her eyes again went to the eagle symbol on her dagger. \thought{Help me, eagle of Clan Geican,} she prayed. \thought{Help me find the strength to reclaim my freedom. Help me return to the glory of Clan Geican.} She paused, laughing softly and bitterly at herself. \tho{Now I am reduced to praying to a piece of heraldry. Truly I have lost my mind.}
