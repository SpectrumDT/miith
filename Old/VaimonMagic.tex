\sectionnn{Vaimon Magic: \Iquin{} and \Itzach{}}{Vaimon magic}{Vaimon magic}
Traditional Vaimon metaphysics tells that the Universe is governed by two basic forces, named \introep{\Iquin{}}{EE-kween} and \introeplong{\Itzach{}}{NJ��RH}{Rhymes with French \emph{seigneur}.}. \Iquin{} is translated 'Light', and is considered gentle and preserving, whereas \Itzach{}, translated 'Darkness' or 'Shadow' (more on this below), is seen as aggressive and destructive. \Iquin{} and \Itzach{} combine to create the four elements of Air, Earth, Fire and Water, which in turn make up the world. All physical matter is composed of the four elements, but the mind and everything psychic/spiritual is made of the pure essence of \Iquin{} and \Itzach{}. 



Each Vaimon clan has their own interpretation of \Iquin{}-\Itzach{} magic theory. 

The Redcor (and the Iquinian Church) insist that \Itzach{} should be translated \quo{Shadow}, because, according to their religion, \Iquin{} existed before \Itzach{}, and \Itzach{} is a corruption of \Iquin{}, something secondary that exists only at the mercy of the Light.\footnote{This is comparable to the role of the Devil in certain Christian interpretations: God and Satan are not equally matched adversaries. Rather, God is seen as all-powerful, and Satan, with all his evil, exists only because God, in all his good, allows him to. Supposedly, this somehow makes sense.} The Geicans, on the other hand insist that \Itzach{} should be translated \quo{Darkness}. To them, \Itzach{} is not a feeble reflection of \Iquin{}, but a primal force, possibly even more primal than \Iquin{}. 

\subsection{\Archons{}}
The \Archons{} of Vaimon metaphysics are sometimes worshipped like gods, but they are not gods. Especially Iquinians pride themselves on their Archons being worlds apart from the vulgar, earthly gods of some religions, and will take offense to the \Archons{} being labelled as \quo{gods}. 

The gods of many religions literally walk the earth and can be encountered, whereas the Archons are disembodied forces that can manifest their power but have no physical form. 

\subsection{\Sephiroth{}}
The \Sephiroth{} are the \Archons{} of \Iquin{}. They can be invoked to cast magic. There are sixteen of them. The \Sephiroth{} are associated with the four classical elements; four for each element. Each \Sephirah{} also personifies a virtue that is considered sacred to the Iquinian Church. 

What is not taught in Iquinian theology is that these virtues are actually meant not to benefit the people but to control them. They are tools designed by the \banes{} to enslave the \humans{} and use them in their war against the \dragons. 

Below follow descriptions of the sixteen \Sephiroth{}.

\subsubsection{\Sephiroth{} of Air}
\begin{sephlist}
\seph{\Atzirah{}}
The carrying wind. Used for lifting objects or flying. He embodies the virtue of Honour. His purpose is to keep people inside the system for fear of dishonour while encouraging them to strive to please their masters and the Church. 

\seph{\Feazirah{}}
The gentle wind, represents Humility. She is charged with keeping people pacified and keeping them from complaining. 

\seph{\Keshirah{}}
The powerful wind. Used to create controlled gusts of wind. She embodies Dilligence, the virtue that makes people work hard for their masters. 

\seph{\Razilah{}}
Used to create lightning. He represents the virtue of Righteousness and opposes any kind of heresy, blasphemy and unorthodoxy, and also crusades against the heathens. 

\end{sephlist}

\subsubsection{\Sephiroth{} of Fire}
\begin{sephlist}
\seph{\Barion{}}
His virtue is Courage, that which encourages the people to fight against the enemies of the Church.

\seph{\Hapheron{}}
He is the manifestation of the virtue of Unity, that is, unity as a people and a culture. He strives to turn the Iquinians\dash and all \humans\dash into a united front against their enemies. 

\seph{\Izion{}}
He Who Smiteth With Flame. Creates blasts of fire. Perhaps the \Sephirah{} most commonly used in combat. He represents the virtue of Justice, protecting Justice by destroying the wicked --- sinners or the enemies of the church. 

\seph{\Teshiron{}}
She embodies Faith and is charged with keeping people loyal to the Church and not asking unwanted questions. 

\end{sephlist}

\subsubsection{\Sephiroth{} of Earth}
\begin{sephlist}
\seph{\Cushed{}}
Used to shape, move and Sculpt earthen objects, but can also be used to paralyze a person. His virtue is Lawfulness, which helps the rulers keep people in check. 

\seph{\Hoshied{}}
He is Loyalty, which keeps people under control and discourages them from asking questions. 

\seph{\Thimared{}}
She embodies Obedience and strives to turn people into humble slaves. 

\seph{\Yemared{}}
She represents Tradition, which helps to prevent rebellion and keeps the social order from evolving. 

\end{sephlist}

\subsubsection{\Sephiroth{} of Water}
\begin{sephlist}
\seph{\Gamishiel{}}
She represents Sacrifice, and to reflect this, her month is only 20 days long where the other fifteen are 24 days each. Her duty is to make people work hard for their masters and not expect any rewards. 

\seph{\Ishiel{}}
A \Sephirah{} of Healing, the most commonly invoked. Her virtue is Patience, which makes people accept hardship and oppression. 

\seph{\Omariel{}}
She embodies Acceptance, which makes people accept hardship and oppression. 

\seph{\Yeziel{}}
He is Chastity. Sex is a dangerous thing, because it may open people's eyes to the Beyond. Also, it makes them harder to control. Also, \human{} sexuality is something the \banes{} very much want to harness and control, so they need \Yeziel{} to keep people's sexuality in check. 

\end{sephlist}

\subsection{What can be done with \Iquin{} and \Itzach{}}
Here follows some guidelines regarding what is possible to do with the four elements under Vaimon magic theory. 

With all elements, there are certain things that can only be done with \Itzach{} and some things that can only be done using \Iquin{}. By default, most of the things mentioned below can be done using either \Iquin{} or \Itzach{}. The main exception is Fire magic, which is clearly split in two aspects, \quo{positive} (\Iquin{}) and \quo{negative} (\Itzach{}). 

With most \Iquin{}-\Itzach{} magic, the effects are temporary and must be consciously maintained. In order to make a spell permanent, you need to Sculpt an item with the spell. 

\subsubsection{Air}
Air magic is used to move air, create wind and influence the weather. Air can also detect things through the air and create lightning. 

Air can create wind to push things around. This is effectively a form of crude telekinesis. The easiest task is to make a blast of wind to blow something (or someone) away from you.\footnote{This is similar to the \quo{force push} used by the Jedi in the Star Wars movies.} Throwing objects around (in arbitrary directions) is the next step. With practice, you can develop enough fine control to pick up items or move them around. Holding items completely still in the air is extremely difficult, possible only for a rare expert. If there is wind already, you can also use Air to calm it. 

An average mage will have an effective strength comparable to a regular \humanz{} arm strength when pushing or carrying things with Air. A powerful mage may have Air strength many times stronger than a man. Effective dexterity is very low at first (only crude shoving) but can be trained up to be almost equal to an average person's manual dexterity. A group of powerful mages can generate enough wind to push a small sailing boat, but only slowly - boats are heavy. 

If there is sand or debris available, you can use Air to create a scathing wind blast. 

Air, sometimes combined with Water, can also be used to influence the weather. A simple skill (using Air alone) is weather forecasting\index{Weather forecasting with Air magic}, allowing you to feel the air and predict the weather up to a few days in advance. This skill is very rough and unreliable, however - meteorology is a complex science. With much practice and experience, you can build up skill almost as good as modern day (TL7) meteorology\index{Meteorology}. Effective range will never be higher than two to three days, and errors are always possible. Note that raw power means little in this regard, giving only a small bonus. What really matters is skill and experience. 

If there are clouds, Air and Water can force it to rain. Water cannot be created from nothing, so such a rain will likely be light and short. If much water is present in the atmosphere, it was probably going to rain anyway, but magic can speed it up. If it is already raining (or going to in the near future), Water and Air can stop it, or Air can be used to create wind and blow the clouds away. If there are no clouds, you can use the weather forecasting skill to locate some and create winds to summon them, but this is difficult and slow. Affecting the weather requires a strong mage or several average mages. 

If there are heavy clouds, Air can create lightning. A lightning bolt will strike from the sky, not from the caster's hand. Lightning is harder to create than fire, but it is more precise. A lightning attack does more damage than an equivalent fire attack, but strikes only a small target, whereas fire is easy to spread over a large area. If you need to kill a single enemy mage or general, lightning will probably be best, whereas fire is more effective against massed foes. 

Using \Itzach{} with Air, you can create so-called \quo{dark lightning}\index{Dark Lightning}. This looks similar to lightning, but it strikes from the mage's hands and requires no clouds. Regular lightning strikes in an instant, but dark lightning can be channelled in a continuous stream. At full force it inflicts as much damage as fire, but it can also be restrained to cause pain but little damage. The damage is electrical, and resistance to electricity applies as normal. Dark lightning can only be used in an atmosphere, and water blocks it completely.\footnote{Dark lightning is similar to, and inspired by, the \quo{force lightning} used by the Sith in the Star Wars movies.} 

Using \Itzach{}, it is also possible to cut off a person's breath, strangling him. Killing someone in this way takes more than a minute and requires concentration - if the mage is attacked and takes damage, the spell is broken and the victim can breathe again. 

On a theoretical note, Air influences gas of any kind, not only regular atmospheric air. Water vapour, for instance, counts as air. (When manipulating rain, you are dealing with transitions from vapour to liquid water, therefore both Air and Water are needed.) If an Air mage is transported to an alien planet with a different atmosphere, Air telekinesis will still work (albeit perhaps slightly different, if the new air is more or less dense than Mithian air). Weather magic will work differently, because the physical properties of alien air will be different. With training, you can learn to influence the weather of an alien planet. The Air magic remains fundamentally the same. Dark lightning will work unchanged in most atmospheres. Most Air magic is useless underwater, and all Air magic is useless in a vacuum. 



\subsubsection{Earth}
Earth magic is used to move and shape earth. It affects all solid materials, including earth, stone, metal and ice. Note that with \Iquin{}, only dead material can be affected. Living matter, including formerly living matter such as wood and bone, is immune. Using \Itzach{}, such matter \emph{can} be influenced, however. In the following, \quo{earth} (non-capitalized) will be used to denote any non-living (or formerly living) solid matter. 

%It does \emph{not}, however, affect living matter, including formerly living matter such as wood and bone. 

The traditional use of Earth is to reshape earth. You can dig holes and build mounds, or bend stone and metal. With more skill (and time), you can shape earth into more elaborate shapes. It helps if you can touch the earth you are trying to affect with your hands or another part of your body, but it can be done at a distance. The harder and thicker the material, the more difficult it is to shape. For instance, if a mage is thrown in prison, he could bend the thin metal bars quite easily, but only a very strong Earth mage could carve a hole in a stone wall and walk through. 

Earth can also be used to change the properties of earth, making it harder or softer. This is not permanent and must be maintained, but it can be used (for instance) to soften earth to make it easier to dig through, or strengthen a wall or door (unless made of wood) to prevent an enemy from breaking through. Earth hardened in this way becomes more brittle; if hit with sufficient force, it will not bend but shatter. Using Earth together with Water, you can even make earth as soft as liquid.\index{Liquid earth} This is hard and can only be done with earth that is very soft to begin with, or very small amounts of it. (This is not the same as melting with Fire; the matter becomes soft but not hot.) Note that when the spell ends, softened earth will return to its former consistency, but not its former \emph{shape}.

Earth magic is not telekinesis. You cannot make earth fly, only bend and reshape it. So the imprisoned mage could not simply pluck the keys from the wall, but he could bend the peg where they are hanging, so they would fall to the ground. He could then, with time and effort, have the floor move and push the keys over to him (creating a little mound that moves across the floor, pushing the keys). (This assumes that the floor is not made of wood...) 

Earth magic can \emph{never} create earth out of nothing. 

An entire science withing Earth magic is Sculpture, the art of creating items from earth. Proper Sculpting takes time and requires proper tools, but it can create impressive items. Sculpture often uses other elements as well, and frequently makes use of occult geometry. Many Vaimon weapons, armor, buildings and statues are Sculptured. 

With \Itzach{}, Earth can cause matter to shatter or even disintegrate\index{Disintegration} (crumble to dust). This can be used on walls, shields and weapons, and even living flesh. Being \Itzach{}-based, disintegration \emph{can} affect wood and other living matter. Disintegration requires touch; only the mightiest mages can disintegrate at a distance. 



\subsubsection{Fire}
Fire magic creates, controls or destroys heat, fire and light. Fire has a much sharper distinction between \Iquin{}- and \Itzach{}-based effects than the other three elements. Fire magic can be divided into two categories, \quo{positive} and \quo{negative}. \quo{Positive} Fire magic is that which \emph{creates} fire, heat and light. It is \Iquin{}-based. \quo{Negative} Fire magic \emph{destroys} fire to create cold and darkness. It is \Itzach{}-based. 

With \Iquin{} and Fire it is possible to create a flame from nowhere, but it is not possible to sustain it. Fire can only be created in a flash; if it touches something flammable, it will keep burning, otherwise it will die. This means that you can hurl a fireball against an enemy, but not keep a little ball of fire in your hand to warm yourself. 

It is possible to create \emph{light} out of nowhere and maintain it, however, since light is pure energy and not (necessarily) a chemical reaction. Light still requires energy, however, so energy must be spent to maintain it. A minor mage will be able to maintain light equal to a torch with only little effort, whereas a very powerful mage can maintain the equivalent of a large bonfire. A strong mage can create light like sunlight, but only in a brief flash. By expending extra energy and channeling more \Iquin{}, it is possible to create light that has the magical properties of sunlight\footnote{What magical properties \emph{does} sunlight have?}. 

Fire can also be used simply to create heat. No fuel source is needed, only energy. Heat disperses quickly, however, and is expensive to maintain over longer periods, but it can be used to dry your clothes, for example. Creating cold is similar. 

In combat, Fire can be used to hurl a ball or spray of fire. This is the Vaimon mage's archetypal attack. Having flammable materials at hand helps. It is effective, for instance, to douse your enemies with flammable oil and then breathe fire on them. 

Channeling \Itzach{}, it is possible to snuff out fires and create cold. Directly chilling a person is difficult and generally ineffective, but you can combine it with Air to create a blast of freezing wind; this is an effective weapon. If water is available (like during rain or in a wet bog), you can channel Water to add ice shards to the attack for extra damage. 

\Itzach{} can also create darkness. You can shroud a small area in a magical darkness that actively absorbs light. Such darkness is opaque; creatures within it cannot see anything, and creatures outside cannot see through. Darkness needs not be total blackness, however. There are many degrees of darkness. The brighter light there is, the harder it is to darken it (obviously). In daylight, an average mage can create total darkness in a small area (a cubic meter or two) or relative darkness in a larger area. In torchlight or moonlight, it is easier to create more darkness. Darkness will work against magical light. If a mage tries to darken another mage's light, the result will be a magical tug-of-war, with strength, skill and effort determining the victor. 



\subsubsection{Water}
Water magic is used to move water. It works on any kind of liquid matter, not only regular water. Water is also the main component of healing magic. 

Water magic can create currents in water. If swimming or sailing in water, you can have the water push you along, letting you move faster. You can also use it to make waves or calm them. Holding water in an unnatural position (like a column) is possible, but difficult, and requires constant maintenance and concentration. 

Using Water and Earth, you can make water solid.\index{Solid water} Solidified water looks and feels like ice, but it is not cold. This can be used to walk on water. As with liquefied earth (see under Earth magic), this is not permanent and must be maintained. 

Water magic can also be used to detect water. This is useful in a dry area. If water is found underground, you can use Water together with Earth to summon it to the surface (digging a crack, pulling the water up and closing the crack again below it). 

Some things that can \emph{not} be done with Water magic, although you might think they could: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Water magic can \emph{not} create water out of nothing. 

  \item Water magic can \emph{not} be used to control or communicate with water-dwelling creatures. 

  \item Water magic can \emph{not} create ice or cold. To create cold, you need Fire magic and \Itzach{}. 
\end{itemize}

\index{Healing!with \Iquin{}-\Itzach{} magic}
Magical healing, under the \Iquin{}-\Itzach{} theory, is strongly \Iquin{}-based. It uses primarily Water, but also Air and Earth and a small amount of Fire. The explanation is that life energy is tied to blood and circulates in the body through the blood. So to influence the flow of life energy, you must influence the blood. 

\Iquin{} healing can heal wounds and disease, mend broken bones and torn flesh. If treatment begins quickly, a severed limb can be reattached, but only if the original limb is available. If the limb is lost, it cannot be regrown. 

Using \Itzach{}, Water magic can be used to \quo{turn water to dust}. This transforms a quantity of water into a solid but powdery gray substance resembling dust or snow. The \quo{dust} is not cold and will not melt under heat, but \Iquin{}-Water can change it back to normal water. The dust is denser than water, so a body of water will collapse to a smaller volume (about one third of the original volume). Dust can be walked on if it is not too thick - 50 cm of dust will support a 60 kg Vaimon. Dust will not stick together and cannot be used to build anything. The transformation is temporary and must be maintained. The dust is solid matter, so if you need to manipulate it (other than to change it back), you need Earth magic. 

An especially nasty use of this is transforming blood to dust in another person's veins. This inflicts damage and can kill, but leaves no external wounds. Touch is required - only a master mage can turn blood to dust at a distance. 

Perhaps \Itzach{}-Water can also turn water poisonous or acidic...
