\section*{Disclaimer}
\booktitle{\RungerWarBook} is not a moral story. 
Nor is it amoral. 
It is deliberately immoral, containing not only the depiction but the active glorification of all sorts of wickedness, including killing, rape, demon worship and bad language. 

As such, the book is intended for sane readers only. 
If you are impressionable and liable to get warped and ape evil behaviour after reading about it, then read no further. 
Go grow up instead. 

\booktitle{\RungerWarBook} contains no allegories, parables or morals. 
%If you find one, you're wrong. 
Any real-world similarities are shallow at best. 
Any messages you find are of your own making, not mine.
