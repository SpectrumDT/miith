\tho{Almost there...}

\index{Rian}
Deftly concealed by his body, Rian's knife closed in on the strap holding the purse. The fat merchant was still unsuspecting. After all, the market was crowded at this time of day, and the young boy had picked his best cloak, so as not to stand out too much here among the upper tiers of the citizenry. 

Rian rarely ventured into the merchants' quarter, or any other of the wealthier parts of Malcur. Granted, there were great rewards to be reaped by a skilled thief, but the danger was accordingly higher. In the slums, people were left to police themselves; steal from a man who looked slower and less agile than yourself and you were usually safe. Here in the merchants' quarter they had city guards, and there was the very real risk of getting caught. For a lowlife like him, stealing from a higher citizen might lose him a hand, or even earn him the gallows. So, even though the pickings could be gold rather than copper, few thieves thought it worth the risk.

%Rian would normally never have come here, but Badrick and the others had 
\hypota{What'll it be, Rian?} Badrick had asked him. 
\hypota{You gonna be a real man? Or are you just a pussy?} 
The gang leader was really named Patrick, but everyone agreed that was too \quo{nice} a name for a rugged thug, so to everyone that mattered, he was Badrick. 

\hypota{All the rest of us have done it, you know,} Evar had prodded. 

\hypota{You're gonna have to prove yourself,} Badrick had warned. 

Long story short, Rian had been dared into sneaking into the merchants' quarter, east of the slums where he lived, and bring back a trophy. 

\tho{%
  Almost there...
  
  Mustn't shake...
  
  Mustn't be nervous...
  
  Ow!}

All of a sudden Rian was pushed from behind, and had to hurry and retract his hand, so as not to cut open the fat man's gut. He quickly concealed the knife under his cloak as he was borne forward by a wave of people. Rian turned and craned his neck, expecting to see riders cutting through the crowd, but found none. 

\tho{A nobleman, perhaps? Or soldiers? On foot?} 

The boy, being of no more than average height, 
%Being a boy of no more than average , Rian 
could see nothing through the massed people. Curious now, he ducked and began elbowing his way to the front. This drew curses and the odd blow from the people he pushed through, but no more than the lowlife was used to. 

%Finally he reached the crowd frontline. 
What he found as he reached the crowd frontline was both more and less than he expected. Two \scathae, a tall \dax{} in the lead and a smaller \sphyle{} following. %, both unremarkable at first. 
At first sight both seemed unremarkable. 

\tho{Why did the crowd part for these two?}

%As he studied them closer
%Then, as he studied them closer, it suddenly struck him: 
Then it struck him: 
\tho{That is a strange-looking \dax.} His scales were pure black, glossy like some kind of precious stone. Rian had never seen a black \scatha{} before. Blue, red, occasionally green, but never black. 
\tho{How could I not notice this straight away?} 

As he studied the pair closer, new details seemed to appear out of nowhere. The \dax{} was very tall, seven feet at least. His garb was all black with occasional lines of silver and blood red. Dressed in a long cape over what appeared to be metal armour, he looked the part of a warrior, but he bore no weapon that Rian could see. 
The two ridges on his head were strangely elongated, almost like a pair of slim, backwards-curling horns. 

%As Rian stood and stared, 
Then, slowly, calmly, not breaking his stride, the black-scaled \dax{} turned his head slightly and, with a slight smile on his lips, fixed Rian with his gaze. It was only a glimpse out of the corner of his right eye, 
but it so startled the young thief
%but Rian was so startled 
that he immediately, instinctively ducked out of sight and back into the crowd. 

Rian silently cursed himself. 
\tho{Dumbass! Dumbass! Dumbass!} Acting guilty was the worst thing a thief could do, anyone knew that. When a passer-by noticed you, you acted like nothing was out of place. The best way to invite suspicion was by \emph{being suspicious}. 

%But the look in that eye had been more than the boy could take in. It spoke volumes about... something... abnormal. Inhuman. Larger than life. Unnatural. Wisdom, terrible power... and somehow, splendour. 
%and awe-inspiring majesty. 
%And the eyes themselves glinted red, as if a mystic fire burned behind them.  \tho{Who is he? \emph{What} is he?} 
But that stare had been more than the boy could take in. 
The eye glinted yellow. 
Not just the a regular yellow eye\dash uncommon but not unheard of. 
No, this eye shone. It \emph{burned}. 
As if a mystic fire burned behind it. 

And the \emph{look} in that eye! It had spoken volumes of cryptic meaning. Of something... abnormal. Inhuman. Larger than life. 

Unnatural. 

Wisdom, terrible power... and somehow, splendour. 

\tho{Who is he? \emph{What} is he?} 

Meanwhile, the crowd was resuming its natural rhythm, and Rian, curiosity aroused further now, had to hurry to catch up with the pair. \tho{Screw the pickpocketing. This I can't afford to miss.}

He found the onyx-scaled \dax{} and his companion continuing along in their little bubble in the crowd. As Rian formulated that thought, something dawned on him: 

\tho{Why is no one else reacting?} 

People moved out of the travelers' way, but their faces and movement showed no fear nor deference. Their faces showed nothing out of the ordinary. And stranger still, no one seemed to cast a glace at the great black-armoured warrior. They scuttled aside for no apparent reason, without ever noticing it. Rian studied the people around him, but found no one apart from himself who had taken note of anything extraordinary.

\tho{What is going on here? Has everyone been struck blind and stupid?}

The enigmatic pair traveled north, seemingly heading for the Palace. \tho{I'm going to follow them. Maybe that'll lead me to some clue as to what's going on...}

\subsection{To the dead garden}
\end{comment}

\new
\tho{They're heading for the dead garden,} Rian realized. \tho{They must be. What are they after?}

The mysterious pair became yet more mysterious by the moment. The dark one's tail was strangely snaky, whipping back and forth like that of a cat. Certainly nothing like the mostly rigid tail of any normal \scatha. His snout was slender in the middle but widened slightly at the end, unlike the blunted triangle forms of ordinary \scathaese{} snouts. The ridges above his eyes were unnaturally elongated, tapering backwards almost like horns. And that glow in his eyes. Baleful, and yet fascinating. Rian half-imagined the black-scaled one to be some mighty \dragon{} or \daemon{} out of legend. 

\tho{A \dragon. Who's assumed \scathaese{} form to take a stroll through Malcur.} 
He laughed inside at the absurdity of that. 
Besides, there were no more \dragons{}, not in this day and age. 
If they ever existed at all. 

The \sphyle\dash evidently an attendant of the black one's\dash was much less outlandish. At least she was shaped like a normal \scatha. Her scales were of a bright red, almost fiery. Her garb was certainly not \Malcuric, but looked like what a wealthy travelling merchant might wear. Red, brown and orange \colours. Leather as well as silk and other expensive materials. And in contrast to the unarmed but armoured warrior, the \sphyle{} carried a long, curved dagger in her belt, made from some metal darker than iron, almost black. 
It was adorned with \dragons{} and serpents crawling up and down the hilt and sheath. Such weapons were often unwieldy and nigh-unusable for other than ceremonial purposes. But in this case, the ornamentation somehow made the blade look \emph{more} dangerous. %, as was often the case with such weapons. 
%Ornate, but not so excessively as to turn it into an unwieldy, ceremonial piece. \Dragons{} and serpents crawled up and down the  
%Overall, while the female lacked the menacing aura of her armoured companion, 
%From this one, Rian 
Studying it, Rian felt a nagging apprehension that the encarved serpents were watching him through their cold, reptillian eyes, poised to strike. Disconcerted, he had to look away from the weapon. 

Indeed, while she may lack the powerful, menacing aura of her armoured companion, the \sphyle{} was still one whom Rian would not dare steal from, however heavy her purse might be. 

Their path had led near to the centre of the city. The colossal \CastlePelidor{}\dash home of the \rayuth, ruler of Malcur and of all Pelidor\dash was visible even from the slums, looming forebodingly in the distance as a reminder of all that separated the lowlives from their highborn lords. But here, it towered over everything. Even though it was still distant and would take a long walk to reach\dash Rian guessed a thousand paces or more\dash, already its white marble walls seemed to span almost the entire horizon. Immense towers rose up to touch the sky, their brass-coated roofs gleaming like small suns. 
Friezes and statues adorned the walls, of armoured knights, angels, beasts and dreadful monsters; some of them huge, many times taller than a man. 
Rian found himself in the line of sight of a giant angel of marble\dash androgynous, winged, brandishing aloft a flaming sword, as if to strike with righteous anger down upon the thief's sinful head. He hurried on, eager to put some buildings between him and the avenging stone angel. 

\tho{Burning eyes, \Dragons, carved snakes, and now angels. I'm letting superstition drive me nuts.} So he tried to tell himself. 









% \new
% \ta{My lord, why the detour?}
% 
% \ta{For the scenery, \Criseis. It is a nice castle. And it has taken the toll of the millennia quite well.} 









They moved on, turning west from the castle down the road to the bad part of inner Malcur. \tho{To the dead garden.} As they walked, the scenery gradually changed, the tall, bright and shiny homes of the highborn and the wealthy being replaced by weird, twisted edifices. Many of these buildings were still tall and ornate, evidently once glorious like their counterparts nearer the castle, but now strangely decayed, as if abandoned for a generation or more. Some were genuinely empty, but many were still inhabited, and yet still had this decayed look. 
And it seemed, at least to Rian, like more than mere disrepair. Their frames were somehow warped, disfigured, as if by the deliberate actions of some malign haunting spirit. It made them look almost like crooked trees rather than humanoid-built houses. 

Because of the eerie, misshapen buildings, this part of the city was shunned by the upper tiers of society and had thus degenerated into a lower middle class area. Still finer folk than slummers like Rian, but noticeably beneath the standard of neighbouring quarters. 

\tho{They must be headed for the dead garden,} Rian decided. \tho{It makes sense. The garden is mysterious. These \scathae{} are mysterious.}

As they continued, west-southwest away from the castle and the noble quarter, the houses shrank and the standard of living dropped. And as they neared the dead garden, the uncanny decrepitude intensified; buildings seeming to grow more deformed with every street they passed. Finally, the habitation ended, the last rows of houses long empty and crumbling. 

Before them lay the most sinister, mystical part of Malcur. 

It had no name, but was simply called \quo{the dead garden}. When it was referred to at all. Many people seemed unwilling to acknowledge, or even believe in, its existence. And glancing at it, it was not difficult to imagine why. 

The many trees and bushes in the garden were all twisted and misshapen. They seemed withered and dead, or at least dying; \coloured black, pallid white or sickly yellow. Dead, yet somehow very alive, for subtle evidence hinted that the trees not only grew, but also moved; creeping and writhing at the edges of one's vision. 

The garden was scary and unsettling; Rian was not above admitting that to himself (although admitting it to the world was another matter). But at the same time, the place had an allure of the forbidden, the fantastic, the grotesque, an allure that drew Rian in. As a newborn, these sixteen years ago, he had been found in a ruined house not all too far south of the garden, and had always imagined some connection to the morbid orchard. Many times he had fantasized about his origin: Born in the centre of the dead garden, the son of a mystic and powerful witch who had then sped off on some dark adventure. Idle daydreaming, of course, but as an orphan, it was the best he had. 

The two \scathae{} walked to the first line of trees, and Rian followed from some distance, crouching behind a collapsed hovel. 
\tho{Pointless. They've seen me already. They know I'm here.} 
Nonetheless, they were menacing-looking types, and he was not about to step forward and challenge them. 

They spoke together now. 
Rian strained his ears to hear, but the words he caught were in no language he could recognize. 
\tho{What are they saying now?}

\ta{Master, what was that detour for?}

\ta{For the scenery, \Criseis. It is a nice castle. And it has taken the toll of the millennia quite well.} 

\Criseis{} had not found herself able to fully appreciate the architecture. The longer she spent in Malcur, the stronger the alien presence crept into her mind. 
\tho{Something lurks beneath this city.} 
It was hidden well behind the ever-present Shroud, but she thought she could feel the reverberations of immense shapes slithering in the Beyond\dash burrowing in ever-benighted tunnels 'neath the earth, gnawing at the fabric of the Web. She could smell the rank breath of monstrous things pervading the air, and when she reached out with her senses, she thought she could almost feel the clammy skin of some behemoth abomination, coiled about her, smothering her with its massive bulk. 
\tho{But what? What do you hide, Malcur?}

From his hiding place, not comprehending a word, Rian saw the tall \dax{} lift his nose to smell the air. 
His tongue darted out. 
And it was no \scathaese{} tongue! 
A normal \ps{\scatha} tongue looked like a \ps{\human}. 
This one's tongue was long and slim and forked, and he tasted the air with it as would a snake!

The black one straightened and flexed the finger of his left hand. 
Rian squinted, then gaped. 
Those were not \scathaese{} fingers, either! Each of them sported a long claw! 
And when he looked closer, the black one's smile revealed not \scathaese{} teeth (which were no sharper than \psp{\humans}), but fangs.
Again, like a snake! 


%He understood that something was about to happen.
%\tho{This}
The \scatha{} held his right hand in a fist before his chest, touched it with his left, and Rian watched as he raked his sharp claws along the back of his own hand, drawing blood. There was a seething sound, and smoke seemed to rise from the wound... as if the black one's blood was boiling in his veins. He shook the wounded hand and the unearthly blood was freed upon the air, sizzling and bubbling, and then held the hand high in the air for the blood to drip down.

  \emph{All} life. 
  And, perhaps, all death.}

\QuessanthIshnaruchaefir{} then spoke spellwords in the potent and ancient \maybehr{True Draconic}{True \Draconic} tongue. Those arcane words of power never translated well into mortal tongues, but the meaning of the incantation was approximately this: 

\index{\Rystessakhin}

\index{glaive}
\draconicspell{%

  by the blood of the \xzaishanns, \\
  by the blood that is life I give thee form.\\
  I summon thee! \AeocrithRystessakhin! Arise!}

As his speech veered into the True \Draconic{} tongue, his voice changed, becoming unnaturally deep; growling, thundering, as if resounding from the throat of a far vaster creature. 
As if emerging from his true form. 

The air reverberated with the sorcerous power of those words. 
And the seething, hissing blood that spilled from his hand began to coalesce and solidify. 
% Rian squinted again, watching as it took the shape of... \tho{of what?} Some oblong object. \tho{A branch? A rod? An... axe?} Nay, not an axe, but clearly a weapon. 
Gradually it took the shape of an oblong object. 
First it resembled a rough branch. 
Then a rod. 
Then an axe. 
Then finally a scythe-like polearm, half again as long as \Ishnaruchaefir{} in his \scathaese{} form was tall, and crooked, and with not one edge but several wicked blades, pointing both forward and back, making the head almost half as wide from end to end as the shaft was long. 
A scimitar-like spike jutted upward from the top, making the weapon look like a monstrous cross between a halberd and a scythe; another such blade protruded from the back end. 

The flowing blood dried and hardened, taking on the texture of metal. 
The shaft was dull black, but the blades appeared to shimmer between several \colours, and it was as if each \colour embodied a shade of emotion. 
Glossy onyx black was a deep sadness, abandonment, solitude... emptiness. 
Blood red was pain, agony like nails through the heart. 
And a fierce, fiery yellow that was a great, superhuman passion, terrible and cruel in its searing intensity. 
A passion for what might be hunger, or hate, or love. 

Sinister power flowed in waves from the scythe. 
It was the glaive \AeocrithRystessakhin, \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir}{} dreadful weapon. 
\tho{%

  Although it was not \emph{your} blood that was spilled that day, was it, Master \Quessanth? 
  
  But then, in an indirect way, it was.}
And \Criseis{} shuddered to recall that terrible day, when \QuessanthIshnaruchaefir{} had made his dreadful, irrevocable choice. 

The black sorcerer lifted the glaive to his lips, so close he could have kissed it, and whispered soft words, in a \scathaese{} voice again. \ta{I have need of you again, my love. There is work for us...}

\tho{Oh, no. Now he is talking to it.} 
\Criseis{} fidgeted. 
In her experience, whenever her master started talking to the glaive, it meant something nasty was about to happen. 
% Then again, he rarely summoned the artifact in the first place unless he meant for something nasty to happen.

At first, the hapless thief could but stare in awe and terror at the astounding conjuration. But while the black one stood mumbling to himself for a long moment, the Rian's wits gradually returned. 

\tho{A sorcerer! He is a sorcerer!} 

It all made sense now, including the way the \scathae{} had been able to wander all over the city with no one noticing them. He had heard that wizards could do that. 
\tho{An illusion. Or whatever it's called.} 
Rian felt proud of himself for being, it would seem, the only one in the city to see through the illusion. 
\tho{Not so all-powerful, now, are you?} he almost wanted to say. 

But a quick glance at the sinister weapon made him eat those words again, even before he could speak them. 

He peered closer. 

\tho{Is that something... dripping from the blade? 
  Is it blood? Or... tears?} 
The first guess was morbid, but the second was eerier still. Again Rian had to shudder.

His physical fingers twitching slightly. 

His tendrils groped on. 

Then paused. 

He froze. 

Smiled. 

\ta{I have you now.}

% At length, \QuessanthIshnaruchaefir{} broke from his reverie. Again he laid one hand on a branch and concentrated, his aethereal senses searching the Beyond.

% But only for a moment. 

He raised the hand and quietly signalled to his servant with two clawed fingers. 

\tho{He has his prey,} \Criseis{} could tell. She retreated as instructed, away from the trees and into the shelter of a half-ruined house. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} raised the glaive above his head. 
He spoke, and again his voice become impossibly deep and menacing as he intoned {True \Draconic} words of power:

A chilling wave of dread washed over \Criseis{} as her master invoked the forbidden names of the \xzaishanns, 
those dreadful alien gods from whom \Ishnaruchaefir{} and his people derived so much power. 
He spoke arcane words that echoed the ancient covenants forged by \Tiamat, she who discovered the \xzaishanns{} these many thousands of years ago.

These ancient names and titles were so dire, so unwholesome that Rian, who understood nothing of the words, was nonetheless chilled to the core by the dark portent he sensed in them. 

Rian thought he could hear a faint howling, echoing from far off. 
\tho{%
  Things. 
  Terrible things. 
  Blind and savage. 
  Raging.

Then the sorcerer swung the polearm down, ramming the sharp back-end of the shaft into the ground. 

Rian felt the world shake around him. \tho{An earthquake!} was his first thought. But then he realized that the ground under him was actually not moving. The quaking he felt was within his mind. It was as if his brain writhed, convulsed, struggling to break free of its prison inside his skull. He imagined the air around him growing thick, dense. Like water. Fathoms and fathoms of water. Weighing down upon him. Grinding him flat. Squeezing his insides out of him. 

Twisting in pain, Rian gazed up at the sky. Here a new horror assailed his already sorely tested eyes. 
It should by right be noon, 
%the sky had grown dark as midnight from horizon to horizon. 
but as he looked up the Sun was nowhere in sight, and from horizon to horizon the sky had faded to a dusty coal gray. 
And most awful of all were the stars that burned black in that deathly gray sky. Indeed, darker than black. Deeper than any darkness that should exist. They were like holes in the firmament; holes through which the direst, foulest of evils could seep, down from the endless, lightless chasms of nothingness that brood beyond the edge of the world; beyond everything, where all life and light end, where sanity ceases to have any meaning, where only inhuman chaos reigns; stretching on in all directions, forever. Of all this Rian saw a fleeting glimpse in those black stars that hung in the ghastly heavens, and it made him croak feebly his despair and huddle against the ground.

The tremours intensified, even carrying over into the Shrouded world, and the ground of the dead garden in Malcur began to quake in earnest. 

\ta{Time to go meet it. We cannot bring this city down around our ears, after all.}

Some veil like dark smoke obscured the garden, hiding the black one from view. %, giving him only vague glimpses of the black one. 

Then there came a monstrous sound. 

Roaring. 

Shrieking. 

Groaning. 

Rattling. 

From not one throat, but many. If, indeed, things capable of making such sounds had anything as familiar as throats. 

It came from deep beneath the earth. It came from all around him. It came from inside his head. But above all else, it came from the darkened garden. From the centre of the opaque haze. 

He heard a voice, then. Deep, growling, inhuman. But definitely a voice, speaking powerful words in an alien tongue.

\tho{The voice of the sorcerer.} Rian could not remember how he knew this, but he though that un-\scathaese{} voice was somehow that of the dark-scaled sorcerer. 

And a faint, distant howling, barely audible above the monstrous roaring. \tho{Or did I imagine it?}

There! Within the cloud, a flash. The glinting of metal. 

\tho{The scythe...} 

The groaning noises intensified. 

The battle had begun. 

%And there! A glipse of what he thought was the black one
Terrible sounds of combat could be heard. 
The swish of steel through the air. 
The grinding of huge jaws. 
The clash of massive bodies. 
Grunts of pain. 
And terrible words in no \human{} tongue. 

And through the fog, through the blur that veiled everything, he saw glimpses. Flashes of light... \tho{Lightning? Fire?} 
The writhing of towering things... \tho{A worm? Worms?}
And black scales. Immense dark wings. Claws. Teeth. Horns. Blades. 
The splattering of alien blood. 

Rian did not know how long the battle went on. It could have been heartbeats, or a whole afternoon. \tho{Or a whole night, if I am dreaming.} 

Then suddenly, a high shriek ripped through his ears like a knife. 

The shriek became a rattle. 

The thrashing of a huge body, or bodies.

Seething, like boiling water. 

Thumping. 

Then silence. 

A long moment passed. 

\tho{%
  Is the battle over? 
  
  Who won?}

The silence stretched. Again he had to struggle to stay awake. The world swam before his eyes. \tho{Must not doze off. Must not.}

Then, movement. 

Rian tried to focus his blurred eyes. At the edge of the garden, something. Something was emerging. 

Black. With a great bladed weapon. 

\tho{The sorcerer. He prevailed.}

%Rian saw clearly as the creature appeared. 
%It was like a man, but in all ways greater. He stood seven feet or more, taller than even the black-scaled \scatha. His skin, too, was obsidian black. His androgynous face was beardless and youthful, but his hair flowed long and shining white. And, most incredible of all, huge white-feathered wings sprouted from his back. 
Rian saw clearly as the two figures appeared. 
%There were two of them, a man and a woman. 
They were like \humans{}\dash a man and a woman\dash but... \emph{greater}. In all ways, greater. 

The one in front, the male, was immensely tall, overtopping even the great \scatha{} by a whole foot. 
His skin was obsidian black, his flawless face beardless and youthful, his hair flowing long and shining white. 
And, most incredible of all, huge white-feathered wings sprouted from his back, spread wide and spanning twice his height
%to a massive span of twice his height.
% each being's height\dash his pure white, hers gray and tipped with black.

\index{pistol}
Having materialized high up in the air, he now descended with gentle flaps of his wings. 
He was dressed in an immaculate robe, white like his hair and wings and adorned with silver and diamonds. 
His black-skinned hands had long nails lacquered pearly white. 
Every one of his ten fingers was decorated with a jeweled ring. 
In his hand he held a long-barrelled pistol of shining gray metal with a handle of what looked to be ivory. 
A very long object was slung across his back\dash possibly a staff or polearm. 
The upper edges of his wings were covered by a slim shin of silvery metal that seemed to taper to a sharp, sword-like blade. 

She was wingless, but hovered in the air nonetheless. 
%The woman was 
Shorter than the male, her skin ashen gray skin and hair raven black,
she wore a dress fit for any queen or princess, striped and patterned in glinting gray, black and silver. Her jewelry, too, was of silver, and a sabre hung scabbarded at her side. 

Rian he was struck dumb. He could but cower and stare. 
Surely these resplendent beings must be angels! 
The woman's beauty was such that the young man was very near ashamed that that he had once though mortal women attractive. 
But the male was even more glorious in his radiant, androgynous perfection. 
\tho{%
  Such magnificence. Such might. 
  %And such beauty, beyond any man or woman.
  No, not an angel. A god!
  %... nay, gods! \tho{
  Before my eyes... a god in the flesh!}
The \human{} would have fallen flat on his face in worship of these superhuman avatars, had he the courage to move at all.

The god softly alighted, the goddess close behind him, as with shining silvery he eyes regarded the scythe-wielding sorcerer, stained now with putrid slime. 
\tho{I see now! The god has come to vanquish this warlock and his black magic.} 

Rian strained his memory. 
\tho{What was the \ps{\scatha} misdeed? What had he been up to?} 
But he could not remember. He had followed the sorcerer and his companion through the city to the dead garden, and... something had happened. The sorcerer had worked his forbidden magic. That must be it. And now the god had come to punish this blasphemy.

The white-clad male \resphan{} spoke then, in the tongue of his kind. 
\ta{%

\ta{Foolish of you, then, to accost me,} \Ishnaruchaefir{} replied in his own language.

\ta{Who are you?}

\tho{%

  She almost broke the age taboo by letting slip that she is from \Merkyrah. 
  Heh.

\ta{%

\ta{Hm. So you came to put me to the test?}

\Teshrial{} put up a frown. 
\ta{It saddens me that you have slain my creature.}

This caused even \Ishnaruchaefir{} to lick his right eye. 
\ta{%
  Your creature, \Teshrial? 
  You summoned the \ghobal? 
  Hm. 
  I am impressed.} 
The fire in \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir}{} eyes seemed to cool as he studied \Teshrial{} with that impaling analytical stare of his. 
As if seeing into his soul. 
Exhuming and laying bare all the \ps{\resphan} fears and weaknesses. 
\ta{%
  What a shame that your scheme is now ruined. 
  You have my sincerest condolences for senseless waste of your hard work.%
}

\ta{I am sure I do.}

Without warning, \Teshrial{} aimed his pistol and fired. 
Beams of searing light lanced forth in rapid bursts. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} was struck and fell back, raising his glaive to ward off further attacks. 

% \Teshrial{} leapt into the air, gesturing with his free right hand and mumbling some words. 
% But \Ishnaruchaefir{} was faster. 
% The sorcerer growled a single word:

\Criseis{} took cover. 
She knew better than to be in the line of fire when her lord joined combat. 
She noticed \Achsah{} backing off too, making no move to aid her lord. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} prepared a spell, gesturing with his free right hand and mumbling some words. 
But \Teshrial{} was faster. 
He spread his wings and leapt into the air, firing more bursts of energy from his pistol. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} took several hits and stumbled back a step, his concentration seemingly disrupted. 

He raised his glaive and intoned spellwords. 
Chaotic energy began to course through the glaive, like red lightning running up and down the shaft. 
Again \Teshrial{} fired, and a harpoon of shimmering energy jabbed into \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir}{} side. 
Again \Ishnaruchaefir{} grunted, and again his spell fizzled. 

\Teshrial, more confident now, charged forward. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} raised a hand and growled a single quick spellword:
\ta{\kingstongue{\Guthnyad!}}

\Criseis{} glimpsed an incorporeal \daemon{} as it sprang from the air near her master, speeding through the air at the \resphan. 
A shapeless blur of some unearthly \colour. 
\tho{A \daemonic{} \colour, found nowhere in the World of the Shroud.}

\Teshrial{} grunted in pain as the lightning-quick \daemon{} tore into him.

\begin{comment}
  Ishnaruchaefir charges. 
  Teshrial hops to his feet, dances out of the way and deflects the attack with a strong blow of his wing. 
  
  Teshrial leaps back and has time to fire his pistol a few times. 
  Ishnaruchaefir has to fend off the attack, which slows him down. 
  This gives Teshrial time to back off further, dump the gun and draw his senaan. 
  
  Ishnaruchaefir charges again. 
  Again Teshrial dodges and parries with his wing. 
  This time, before Ishnaruchaefir can attack again, Teshrial is lightning-quick and swings the senaan and hits Ishnaruchaefir. 
  
  Teshrial casts a spell. 
  A blow of entropy strikes Ishnaruchaefir's body. 
  His Xzai-Shann energy rejects the entropy, but it is costly for his body. 
  A great wound springs open and blood fountains. 
  
  But by now Ishnaruchaefir is close enough that Teshrial can't dance out of melee range. 
  So Ishnaruchaefir draws on his stamina, ignores the painful wound and presses the attack. 
  He swings the glaive directly down on Teshrial. 
  
  Teshrial brings up his senaan in a parade that is technically perfect. 
  It should deflect the glaive and place Ishnaruchaefir in an awkward position afterwards, whereas Teshrial himself would stand in an ideal position to strike.

  His parade should stop any normal attack... but Rystessakhin just shears straight through.

\ta{%
  You cannot defeat me, whelp,} said \Ishnaruchaefir.  
\ta{Not now. 
  Not in ten thousand years.}
He cast a glance up to the sky. 
\ta{No matter how the planets stand.}
With those words he charged, hefting his glaive. 

The downed \Teshrial{}, despite his injuries, quickly scrambled to his feet and leapt out of the way. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} took a swing at the retreating \resphan, but the blow became clumsy and \Teshrial{} easily blocked it with his unhurt left wing. 
Sparks flew as the glaive collided with his silvery wing-blade. 
\index{\kilghan}%
\index{vambrace}%
\emph{\maybehr{Kilghan}{\Kilghain}} they were called, those vambraces for the wings. 
\Resphan{} wings were not nearly as fragile as they looked at first glance, and the \resphain{} utilized them to their full effect in combat. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} was less nimble and slower to turn, so \Teshrial{} had time to retreat several steps and fire his pistol again. 
Sparks flew from \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir}{} armour as he was hit, and seething blood was freed upon the air. 

\index{\senaan}%
\Teshrial{} had evidently realized that he could not avoid \melee{} forever, for he now discarded his gun and unsheathed the long weapon slung across his back. 
It was a \senaan, a type of sword used by the \CiriathSepher. 
It was even longer than \ps{\Teshrial} was tall; so long it was almost a polearm. 
The ivory white handle was nearly three feet long and the silvery, curved, single-edged blade fully seven feet. 

%   Ishnaruchaefir charges again. 
%   Again Teshrial dodges and parries with his wing. 
%   This time, before Ishnaruchaefir can attack again, Teshrial is lightning-quick and swings the senaan and hits Ishnaruchaefir. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} charged again, but again \Teshrial{} was too quick. 
Even grounded, the \resphan{} moved with all the grace of a ballroom dancer and nimbly deflected the blow with his \kilghan-shielded wing. 
Then he spun around and made a stabbing attack with his \senaan. 
The tip bit into \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} shoulder. 
He snarled in pain and anger and twisted around, hoping to pull the weapon from \ps{\Teshrial} grip, but \Teshrial{} quickly retracted it. 

%   Teshrial casts a spell. 
%   A blow of entropy strikes Ishnaruchaefir's body. 
%   His Xzai-Shann energy rejects the entropy, but it is costly for his body. 
%   A great wound springs open and blood fountains. 

Having kept his distance, \Teshrial{} seized the change to cast an offensive spell. 
He unleashed a burst of entropic energy, which \Criseis{} visualized as a bolt of smoky darkness. 
A bleeding wound erupted on \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} left thigh where it struck. 
The life-draining entropy might have reduced a lesser opponent to a withered, lifeless husk, and even her master's body, replete with chaotic \xsic{} energy, had to struggle to shrug it off. 

But he ignored the pain and advanced. 

With his \senaan, \Teshrial{} still had the longer reach, so he had time to strike once more. 
\Ishnaruchaefir{} raised his glaive to parry, but realized too late that the attack had been a feint. 
His glaive was slow to swung, and his misaimed parade left him wide open. \Teshrial{} darted in and stabbed his right shoulder. 
Again \Ishnaruchaefir{} growled, but he took the pain without flinching. 
Now he was close enough that \Teshrial{} could not dance out of \melee{} range. 

He raised \Rystessakhin{} above his head. 

\Teshrial{} braced himself. 
Feet spread, wings and \senaan{} held at the ready to receive the attack. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} struck. 
A wide sweeping blow. 

\Teshrial{} brought up his \senaan. 
Lifted his left wing to support it. 

\Rystessakhin{} came down. 

\Criseis{} could see how \ps{\Teshrial} every movement virtually sparkled with skill and perfection. 
His parade was impeccable. 
It would deflect the attack and force his opponent into an awkward position, whereas \Teshrial{} himself would be left in an ideal position to strike. 

Except for one thing. 
\Criseis{} smiled when she noticed it. 

%   
%   Teshrial brings up his senaan in a parade that is technically perfect.

%   His parade should stop any normal attack... but Rystessakhin just shears straight through. 
%   Teshrial's prized senaan, Turishah, just BREAKS in his hands!

\ps{\Teshrial} technique was flawless. 
Or, it would have been, against a lesser opponent. 
But he had not faced the Destroyer before. 
He had failed to anticipate the sheer brute force of the \ps{\dragonlord} attack. 
Instead of glancing harmlessly off the \senaan{} like it was supposed to, \Rystessakhin{} simply shore straight through. 
\ps{\Teshrial} eyes widened in horror as he realized what was happening... the instant before his \senaan{} \emph{broke} in his hands. 

The glaive continued, mercilessly ripping through \kilghan{} and wing alike. 
\Teshrial{} stumbled back at the last moment, narrowly avoiding a cut that would have sliced open his chest. 

He stared in disbelief at his broken sword and the mangled stump that had been his left wing. 
But to his credit, \Teshrial{} composed himself. 
Stumbling back another step to buy time, he cast another spell, pouring as much energy into it as he could muster. 
Entropic power tore through \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} body, causing blood to fountain from several new wounds. 

%   The glaive tears through Teshrial's right side, arm and wing.

\Ishnaruchaefir{} was hurt, but he refused to let that slow him down. 
He advanced another step. 

\ta{Curse you, Exile!} 
\Teshrial{} spat in desperate anger as he shuffled away. 
\ta{By the \banelords, you will pay for this indignity!} 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} did not reply. 
He raised the glaive. 
Struck again. 

This time \Teshrial{} had no defenses. 
\Rystessakhin{} cut straight through him. 
He slumped back on the ground, limp. 
His head was cloven in two, split down the middle. 
His blood and brains spilled out onto the dirt. 

\Teshrial{} was dead. 

\Criseis{} shuddered. 
\tho{%
  \quo{By the \banelords.} 
  A hideous name. 
  One that normally even the \resphain{} fear to invoke.
}

\Ishnaruchaefir{} straightened. 

\ta{You! \Achsah!} he called, not turning towards the \resvil. 

\Achsah{} had backed further away during the duel. 
\ta{\Ishnaruchaefir,} she replied, cautiously. 

\ta{Deliver a message from me to your lord when he revives.
  Tell him I found him an interesting opponent.
  Tell him I may be inclined to grant him a rematch, should he request it.
  And tell him...}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} smiled.
\ta{Tell him to be better prepared if he decides to challenge me again.}

\ta{Um... yes. I will tell him.}
With that, \Achsah{} quickly made herself scarce. 
She folded the Shroud, submerged into \Nyx{} and faded from sight. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} began to walk away. 
\ta{Come, \Criseis. Our work is done.}
Then he paused.
\ta{Oh, wait. Where is that boy?} 
He glanced over at the \human, who still huddled behind some ruins. 
\ta{I suppose we had better kill the witness.}
He began to move towards the boy. 

% \ta{%
%   I Shrouded him. He will remember little... of the \ghobal, at least. But I fear the \resphainz{} appearance broke the spell.}

\Criseis{} quickly moved in to block his path.
\ta{No! Please, master. I have Shrouded him. He will remember little.}

For a moment \Ishnaruchaefir{} just looked at her with level eyes. 

\Criseis{} twitched under his stare. 
Even though she knew in her mind that he would never harm her, the thought of challenging her lord still filled her with irrational fear. 
It was with some effort that she forced herself to stand her ground.

After a long moment, he sighed. 
\ta{I fear one day your sentimentality will be the death of us, \Criseis.
  But very well. 
  I will indulge you. 
  This time.} 
% He turned away.

Rian froze as the black one met his gaze. Those eyes, glinting with a deep inner fire, once again bored into his soul. Stricken with fear, he wanted to look away, but could not. Not until, after what seemed like a day and a night, the \scatha{} finally released him and moved on. Then he crept beneath the crumbled wooden wall, daring not to even peek. 

He waited there until the footsteps faded in the distance, and then quite some time, before he finally slunk out and made to leave the garden. Above, the sky was blue and the Sun had returned. 

\tho{Returned? What made me think that? Hm. I must be crazy.}

\placestamp{Dark Crescent throne chamber}

% Psyrex sits in his throne chamber. 
% He sees through his Psychic Eyes. These are a kind of telepathic daemons allowing you to see (and use other senses) through them. He has sent several of them to Malcur where they patrol. 
% He inspects the great Nexus point and the various junctions, and is pleased with the progress his underlings are making. The spilled blood and bound souls are channelled along aethereal threads reaching down into Machai, down to Nith'dornazsh. 

\LocarPsyrex{}, archmage and lord of the Dark Crescent, reclined on his throne. 
Green, yellow and red incense smoke swirled all around him. 
In the glare of the flaming braziers along the alls, the wisps of smoke lit up like the aurora borealis, filling the chamber with a rainbow-\coloured mist. 

But \Psyrex{} saw none of that. 
Before his eyes he wore the enchanted crystalline goggles that allowed him to see, hear and feel through the Psychic Eyes he had stationed in Malcur. 
The Eyes were invisible telepathic \daemons{} he had summoned; difficult to control but invaluable for reconnaisance. 
They saw not only the world within the Shroud\dash the Malcur visible to mortal eyes\dash but also into the Realms Beyond, and indeed, into the very weave of the Web of Realms. 

He inspected the great Malcuric \nexus{}\dash a point of convergence in the Web, where a myriad threads met and intertwined. 
The \nexus{} throbbed like a beating heart, sending pulses of life-giving power into the vein-like threads. 
And he inspected the many smaller junction points that surrounded the \nexus, propagating its pulses and vibrations out through the threads\dash threads that governed the lives of all in the city and made up the fabric of the world itself. 

And the pulsing of that spiritual heart, and the \colour of the aethereal lifeblood that flowed in the veins of Malcur, were pleasing to him. 
For in those veins flowed the vital energy of hundreds of mortal souls. 
Souls slain in ritual sacrifice and now bound to the \Matrix{} of the Dark Crescent. 
His slaves in death. 
Those souls were channelled along threads from Malcur and deep into the Beyond. 
With one Psychic Eye \Psyrex{} followed the bound souls as they spiralled down into an aethereal abyss, down into the dark Realm of \Machai. 

% He gazes down there and sees the dread necropolis of Nith'dornazsh with its spires, bulbs and crevices, its walls of flesh, blood and metal. It is now dead and desolate, inhabited only by undead, lifeless machines (!). And he sees all the soul-empowered threads reaching down and latching onto Nith'dornazsh like spiritual chains, preparing to pull the city up from the abyss. 
Down to the necropolis of \Nithdornazsh. 

The sorcerer sent his Eye circling over the fallen city, marvelling at its crooked spires, its bulbs and crevices, its walls of flesh, blood and metal. 
It was colossal, greater than any mortal-built city. 
And it was alive. 
Or, rather, it had been alive once. 
Now it lay dead and desolate, its fleshy parts shrivelled, its dusty streets silent and empty, save for the immortal undead machines\dash shambling hulks of metal and desiccated flesh\dash that still guarded their ancient city, thousands of years after the last breathing inhabitant had expired. 

Down into that ghastly necropolis the threads extended, fastening themselves around spires, latching onto the very ground. 
Like spiritual chains preparing to pull the dead city up from its grave in the abyss. 

Then... a tremour. 

A fierce power shook the myriad threads and chains. 

\tho{A \vertex.

Here in Malcur. 

Its reverberations amplified by the \nexus{} point.

Who? 

A \resphan? 

\Achsah? \Teshrial?} 

Quickly \Psyrex{} cast a spell through the goggles, connecting him to another Psychic Eye, one stationed near the \nexus. 
Here the force of the tremour almost overwhelmed him for an instant, like how the light of the Sun blinds the one who emerges from a dark cave. 

He recognized the presence immediately. 
The vibrations, the smell, the \colours unmistakable. 

\tho{This is no \resphan. 
It is he!} 

The cryptic Wanderer in Darkness.
A terrible elder immortal, greater than any \resphan.

\QuessanthIshnaruchaefir.

A rogue \vertex. 
So much greater a threat by virtue of his sheer unpredictability. 
You never know which side Ishnaruchaefir is on. 

\tho{His presence here could throw everything into chaos. 

Heh. Literally.} 

% Then he feels a fearsome force in the web. A great tremour shakes the myriad threads and chains. 
% A vertex. 
% Here in Malcur. 
% Its reverberations amplified by the Nexus point. 
% "It is he! The cryptic Wanderer in Darkness. A terrible elder immortal, greater than any Resphan." 
% A rogue vertex. So much greater a threat by virtue of his sheer unpredictability. 
% You never knew which side Ishnaruchaefir was on. 
% His presence here could throw everything into chaos. 
% Heh. Literally. 
% Psyrex quickly lets his psychic eyes home in on the Vertex' position. He finds him in the place the Malcurians call the dead garden. A place most tightly fettered and connected to the Nexus point. 

\Psyrex{} quickly had his eyes home in on the \ps{\vertex} position. 
He found him near the outskirts of the city, together with his companion, \Criseis. 
Walking. 

\tho{What is he doing?}

The Psychic Eye followed the immortal on his seemingly aimless frolic through the city, until at last he halted near the centre of the city, in the place the Malcurians called the dead garden. 

\tho{%
  A mystic place. 
  Tightly fettered and connected to the \nexus{} point.
  
  What is he doing now? 
  
  What is this new thing surfacing? 
  
  A \ghobal? 
  
  \Ishnaruchaefir{} knows about the \resphain{} and their \ghobaleth. 
  How does he know? 
  From where does he get his intelligence?
  
  Moreover, he actually manages to draw one of them out. 
  And challenge it. 
  Hah! Such astounding audacity.
} 

\Psyrex{} looked on with great interest as the immortal fought the monster, eventually dispatching it. 

\tho{%
  Taking on \ghobaleth{} in hand-to-hand combat. 
  Insanity. 
  Exactly the kind of insanity to be expected of \QuessanthIshnaruchaefir.
}

Then another \vertex{} tremour. 

Powerful, but more subtle. 

\tho{%
  \Resphan. 
  No, \resphain. 
  Two. 
  One of them with the smell of a \ketheran. 
  
  Ah, yes. 
  \Teshrial. 
  And \Achsah. 
  Interesting. 
  \Teshrial{} does not often show his face like this.
}

He urged his Eye to sneak closer, hoping to catch their words, but their conversation turned out disappointingly short and inane. 
A battle ensued, and \Psyrex{} had to laugh out loud as the \resphain{} were prompty sent packing. 

\ta{%
  Hahaha! 
  That is what you get from facing up to the \draecchonosh. 
  \Ketheran{} scum. 
  Haha.
}

% "What is this? A ghobal? Ishnaruchaefir knows about the ghobaleth. And he actually manages to draw one of them out. Hah. Such astounding audacity."
% He looks on with great interest as the immortal dispatches and destroys the monster. 
% Then another Vertex tremour. The Resphain show up. 
% "Interesting. Teshrial does not often show his face like this." 
% The Resphain are promptly sent packing, and Psyrex has to laugh out loud.
% "Perhaps now you understand, Ketheran scum, that the Draecchonash are not to be taken lightly. Hahahaha." 
% Ishnaruchaefir then departs. 
% Psyrex scratches his head. What was he after? Why pop in to slay a ghobal and then leave? What does he expect to achieve? 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} then departed the way he had come, leaving the Dark Crescent sorcerer scratching his head. 
\tho{%
  What was he after? 
  Why show up in the middle of Malcur, slay a \ghobal{} and then leave? 
  What does he hope to achieve?
}

His thoughts were interrupted by yet another presence, this time intruding not in the physical world but directly into his mind. 

A \vertex{} greater even that \Ishnaruchaefir. 
So vast that it blotted out everything else, filling up the whole world. 
Power bled from it in waves, its potency scathing like fire. 

A terrible voice resounded in his head. 
A voice brimming with majesty and \daemonic{} might. 

The voice of a god. 

The voice of \emph{his} god. 

\Secherdamon. 

\secherdamon{\LocarPsyrex.} 

The mighty sorcerer almost quavered under the onslaught of those {True \Draconic} words, every one seeming to shiver the Web of Realms with the weight of its inherent power. 

\ta{Exalted Lord \Secherdamon.}

\secherdamon{Thou hast felt it.}

\ta{%
  Yes. 
  The presence of...} 
\Psyrex{} paused, hesitant to speak aloud the name of his lord's hated rival. 

\secherdamon{\QuessanthIshnaruchaefir.}

The god's feelings, awakened by the thought of \Ishnaruchaefir, flowed over the sorcerer like a tidal wave of pure chaotic fury. 
There was hatred there, and anger, and... other things. 
\tho{Envy?}

\secherdamon{Knowest thou the implications of this?} 

\ta{%
  No, Exalted Lord, I do not. 
  I cannot guess his motives. 
  But this development worries me. 
  His presence might call down unwanted attention upon our affairs.
} 

\Secherdamon{} was silent for a long while. 
Then: 

\secherdamon{%
  Continue thy work, \LocarPsyrex. 
  Inform \Nzessuacrith. 
  And be watchful of the Cabal. 
  %Learn how they react to this. 
  Study their reaction. 
  
  If \Ishnaruchaefir{} returns... 
  I shall take action.
} 

\Secherdamon{} withdrew from the sorcerer's mind, leaving him feeling drained and empty, deprived of his Exalted Lord's touch. 
He sat long in silence, pondering this situation. 

\tho{%
  \QuessanthIshnaruchaefir. 
  One of the greatest rogue \vertices{} in the known universe. 
  Casually strolling through a city built on top of a major \nexus{} point. 
  Challenging and destroying a \ghobal{} in single combat. 
  Then casually strolling out. 
  
  He knows that everyone worthwhile within hundreds of miles must have noticed. 
  Is he playing a mind trick on us? 
  
  How much does he know? 
  He knows of the \ghobaleth. 
  Or, at the very least, of the \ghobal. 
  
  Does he know of our plans in Malcur? 
  Does he know about \Nithdornazsh? 
  
  And what to do about it? 
  Is this a trick? 
  What is he expecting us to do? 
  Does he seek to aid us or thwart us? 
  
  Curse you, \Ishnaruchaefir. 
  
  \quo{Take action.}
  
  If anyone is capable of \quo{taking action} against \Ishnaruchaefir... then it is \Secherdamon.
