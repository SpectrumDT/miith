\section{Pre-History}
In ancient times there were three peoples that dominated \Miith{}: 
The \krakens, the \xss{} and the \voyagers. 

Only the \krakens{} were native to \Miith{}. 
Billions of years ago they ruled the Realm. 
Then they became tired and went dormant. 









\subsection{World-Gods}
\target{History of the World-Gods}
The \quo{World-Gods} were a race of cosmic gods.
A World-God could merge with a planet and \emph{become} the planet.
In this way they colonized much of the universe.
Two such planets were \Miith and \Erebos. 

The \voyagers waged a neverending war against the World-Gods.

\target{Voyagers slay the World-God of Miith}
After a titanic war the \voyagers slew the World-God of \Miith.
To prevent it from ever rising again the \voyagers created a parasitic \dweomer, the \hr{Heart of Miith}{Heart of \Miith}.
This \dweomer drained energy from the World-God's own \dweomer, the \hs{Dark Heart} of \Miith. 
The Dark Heart remained undead and rotting precisely because the Heart feasted on it like a leech.
And all life on \Miith was spawned by the Heart and lived in symbiosis with the Heart.
What this meant was that all life on the planet really existed only to keep the World-God chained in death. 
All living creatures were prison wardens. 
The blood that coursed through their veins were conduits for the power of the Heart that kept the dead World-God in check.

Thus the World-God created its own monsters to destroy this hated life and allow the World-God to rise again and resume its awful, monstrous life.
These monsters were the \hs{Masters of Negation}, and their servitors were the \hr{Noggyal}{\noggyaleth}.

The Masters of Negation waged war against the \voyagers. 
Eventually the \voyagers left \Miith. 
Billions of years later, this life that the \voyagers{} had created would become the \ophidians. 









\subsection{\Voyagers come to \Miith}
\target{Voyagers come to Miith}
The \voyagers{} came from space in their spaceships. 
They created life in their Genesis Pits. 

\target{Voyagers create the Heart}
The \voyagers{} created the \hr{Heart}{Heart of \Miith} from some Chaos power. 
They shaped \Miith{} into something that looked like modern-day \Miith{}. 

\target{Voyagers create mother-mass}
They tampered with the \noggyal \hs{mother-mass} (which was \hr{Noggyaleth were the first life}{the first life form on \Miith}). 
From it they shaped all sorts of life. 

They enslaved the \noggyaleth and used them as machines and slaves and even houses.
The \voyagers taught the \noggyaleth much. 
Thus was sown one of the seeds that would eventually cause the \pps{\voyagers} downfall. 

When the \voyagers{} shaped all their life-stuff, they unwittingly tapped into a sinister force; the energy of a dark god of life and death: \KhothSell. 
This entity infested their \dweomers{} and their \hs{mother-mass}. 
The \voyagers{} did not discover this until very late. 
From there they could only hope to contain the taint, not cleanse it. 
Later their creations rebelled against them. 









\subsection{\Voyagers erect Palisades}
\target{Voyagers erect Palisades}
\target{Palisades}
The voids between planets were \hr{Horrors of the Void}{filled by all sorts of horrors}.
When the \voyagers settled \Miith hundreds of millions of years ago, they erected dimensional barriers around the Realms of \Miith to keep it safe from these horrors.

In a sense, the \xss were some of these \quo{horrors} that the \voyagers feared.
They were some of the greatest \quo{horrors}.

These dimensional barriers, known as the \Voyagers' Palisades, were an early Shroud-like construction, but much better made (by the super-advanced \voyagers), and so had none or few of the destructive side-effects that the later Shroud had.

The Palisades also kept the \banes out, but eventually the \banes managed to drill through.

The \ophidians had some limited understanding of the \voyagers' work, and they drew on it.
They built the \hr{Crystal Sphere}{\CrystalSphere} to patch up the holes in the Palisades that the \banes had made.









\subsection{Poetic version}
\subsubsection{The \voyagers{} and the \krakens}
Once there were the \voyagers, a race of mighty beings (gods, if one wills) who \travelled across the Universe, seeding worlds they found with life. In primordial time, billions of years ago, they came to \Miith{}, desiring to make the world theirs, a breeding ground for their creations. 

But \Miith{} was not barren. Before the \voyagers{} came, \Miith{} had her own children, her own indigenous life, and the greatest of them were the \krakens, the native overlords of \Miith{}. Terrible creatures they were, and immortal. And they were jealous and cared not for invaders, but craved \Miith{} as their birthright, and when the \voyagers{} sought to conquer their world, they fought. Few were the \krakens{}, numbering scarcely a dozen against the thousands of \voyagers{}, great and mighty in their own right. Yet in their wrath, the \krakens{} proved more than a match for the invaders, and in every conflict they would prevail. With valour and fury the \voyagers{} would fight, and with despair, for the \krakens{} were immortal and wielded the primal power of \Miith{} herself. Their leader and mother, the great \Kraken{} Queen, was the mightiest of all the children of \Miith{}, and none could stand before her when she rose in fury. 

But the \krakens{} were indolent, and they would often sleep, their entire race, for aeons at a time - millions, even hundreds of millions of years. And so, whenever the \krakens{} slept, the \voyagers{} would invade \Miith{}, to populate the planet with myriad life forms of their devise. And every time, after an aeon, the \krakens{} would awake to vanquish the \voyagers{}, scour the world of their creatures and repopulate it with their own spawn. But inevitably, the \krakens{} would once more go dormant, and the \voyagers{} would return to begin their work anew. 

For the \voyagers{} seek ever to perfect life, and \Miith{} is precious to them, for \Miith{} is an anvil on which to forge and shape their creations, their works of art. And a most excellent anvil is Mother \Miith{}, for it is her nature to take what is given to her and break it down and hammer it into a new shape, greater and mightier than before. The \voyagers{} have \travelled the universe for billions of years, and they have known many planets. Many worlds are hostile, wastelands of death that will destroy life and cause it to decline and decay. Other worlds are indifferent, possessed of no powerful energy, positive or negative. They will allow life to exist, but they will not support it. On such worlds, life will persist, but it will stagnate and remain humble and never know greatness. Not so Mother \Miith{}. She is possessed of a soul, and she is strong and fierce and indomitable. A loving mother is \Miith{}, but also cruel. The weak among her children she will destroy, and they shall have no legacy 
and know only oblivion. But the strong among her children she will cherish and glorify. Forged in fire and tempered in blood they shall rise, growing ever stronger, and they shall know greatness. For \Miith{} is a crucible of life, and her like is seldom found in the universe, and the \voyagers{} knew to cherish her. 





\subsubsection{\Moroch{} and the \nagae}
So the history of \Miith{} is divided into such cycles of creation and destruction in the cosmic struggle between these factions, the native \krakens{} and the alien \voyagers{}. 

Our story begins in one such cycle. The \voyagers{} had filled \Miith{} up with their creations, but they were fled, for the stars moved, and they knew that the \krakens{} would soon awaken. And one of the \krakens{} did awaken; in this day and age he is called \Moroch{}. What is his aim we cannot know, but when he awoke he began not to destroy, but to create. From the sea he took primitive beings, creatures of the \voyagers{}, and reshaped them in his own design. He gave them strength of body and mind, and bestowed upon them the power of thought, and he made them his servitors. 

The years passed, a million years and more, and still the \Kraken{} Queen and her brethren slumbered, and even \Moroch{} grew sleepy and fell dormant. But his spawn lived, and they grew and prospered, and they recalled their sire and offered him prayer and tribute. Hybrid children they were, born from the womb of the \psp{\voyagers} creation but fathered by a \kraken{} lord. Lowly they were, yet in this age they were the lords of \Miith{}, and their built their cities in the deep oceans across the globe, and they were the \nagae{}. 















\section{The \Ophidian{} Civilization}
\target{Ophidian humanoids}
Hundreds of millions of years after the \voyagers{} had left \Miith{}, the \ophidians{} evolved\dash also called the \caisith. 
From the ashes of the devastated world they rose up to make themselves its masters.
They went on to form great empires and develop marvelous science and sorcery.









\subsection{Origin of the \ophidians}





\subsubsection{Nibir}
\target{Nibir}
\target{Phaetonian}
\index{Nibir}%
\index{Phaetonian}%
Before the \ophidians, the Nibir dominated \Miith. 
The Nibir were aliens who came from the world of Phaeton. 

A Nibir looked like a giant \emph{Anomalocaris}, but with many long spindly jointless legs like the spines on a \emph{Hallucigenia}, and with many soft \emph{Hallucigenia}-like tentacles on its back. 

They were served by a lesser race called the Phaetonians. 
A Phaetonian was roughly human-sized or slightly larger. 
It resembled a \emph{Marrella} (a trilobite-like creature from the Burgess Shale), but with fewer limbs: 
Four long multi-jointed crab- or spider-like legs and four slimmer \quo{arms}. 





\subsubsection{Metabolism}
\target{Ophidians evolved}
\target{Ophidians half warm-blooded}
\target{metabolism control}
\index{metabolism control}
\index{warm-blooded}
\index{cold-blooded}
The \ophidians{} descended from reptiles who were making the transition from \quo{cold-blooded} to \quo{warm-blooded}. 
Crocodiles, lizards and the like remained cold-blooded, while synapsids, dinosaurs and pterosaurs evolved and become warm-blooded. 

Another group of animals were stranded midways. 
They developed the curious ability to switch back and forth, controlling their own metabolism to \quo{cool down} and become cold-blooded or warm-blooded as they wished. 
In a sense, this gave them the best of both worlds: 
The dynamic speed of warm-blooded creatures coupled with the patience of cold-blooded creatures. 

\citeauthorbook[p.80]{RobertTBakker:TheDinosaurHeresies}{%
  Robert T. Bakker%
}{%
  The Dinosaur Heresies%
}{
  The great serpents succeed by being something a warm-blooded mammal could never be\dash a hunter of infinite patience\ldots{}
}

The early \ophidians{} were crocodile-like in form. 
They developed relatively small bodies (like \humans or smaller). 

Despite their advantages, they were still not quite as effective as the more specialized true cold-bloods and true warm-bloods, so they remained a niche group. 
For many millions of years they evolved to fill special niches. 
Instead of huge size like some \saurians{} (or tiny size, like mammals), the proto-\ophidians{} were forced to take a different evolutionary route: 
They evolved psionic abilities, most notably psychometabolism. 

\target{torpor}
\index{torpor}
The \ophidians{} learned that if they made sure to be as inactive as possible, they could conserve their bodily energy, keep it in reserve and use it to power their brains (and, later, their psionics and sorcery). 
They could go into a state of torpor where their bodies would hibernate and operate at a very low metabolism, but their brains and minds could still work at full capacity. 
By utilizing their torpor strategically, \hr{Ophidian Imperial}{Imperials} would later learn to hoard vast amounts of energy and redirect it for magical purposes. 





\subsubsection{Telepathy and telekinesis}
Their psychometabolistic abilities were linked to a large and powerful brain. 
As their brains grew, this opened up the possibility for them to learn simple telepathy. 
Telepathic sensitivity was a useful survival trait that helped them hunt their prey and escape their own predators. 

They also learned simple telekinesis. 





\subsubsection{Intelligence}
In ancient times, the \ophidians were the underdogs in a vast, hostile world of gruesome alien races and lightly slumbering Elder horrors.
The early \ophidians were not at the top of the food chain. 
They were hunted as pests by the more powerful monsters. 
Only the most cunning \ophidians survived. 

They evolved cunning, stealth and dexterity. 
They learned to manipulate objects, both with their limbs and with telekinesis. 

Living in the ruins of elder civilizations and fighting for their lives, the early \ophidians gradually learned to live together in packs and cooperate. 
Social structure developed. 
They developed the use of tools. 
Gradually they developed intelligence and culture. 









\subsection{\Ophidian rise to power}
\target{Ophidians as underdogs}
From their very inception as a race, the \ophidians were pitted against elder creatures. 
They fought to survive. 
The nascent \ophidians were cunning and swift, and they reproduced quickly. 
They developed science, technology, psionics and sorcery.
Gradually, over the course of many millennia, the tide turned in their favour. 
They were able to push back the elder races and establish their own strongholds.
\Ophidian cities began to emerge. 

The \ophidians were underdogs, but they persevered. 
They managed to steer clear of the worst threats. 
As they learned more about the true nature of the world, they kept from going insane and instead increased in power. 
Their science and sorcery grew, aided in part by alien relics that they discovered. 
There were still horrid things that the \ophidians feared to challenge, but these were dormant threats. 
Those alien forces that actively threatened were ultimately defeated, and the \ophidian race won dominance over the planet. 
They were now a mighty race of scientists and sorcerers.

They grew to become the dominant civilization. 





\subsubsection{Paragons/Imperials}
The \ophidians were individually too weak to challenge the elder races. 
But they had social behaviour, and they had their psionic powers. 
Gradually they learned to take pack cooperation a step further. 
They learned to lend the pack's collective mental power to the leader, allowing the leader to grow much more powerful than an average \ophidian by drawing upon the essence of his pack.
These leaders became known as \emph{paragons}, and their supporters as \emph{vassals}.
This was a form of \emph{\nexus}, with the paragon as an \emph{\apex}. 
In time, the \ophidians also learned that a paragon could act in turn as vassal to a greater paragon. 

The \ophidians discovered that\dash at great cost\dash they could imbue an egg with extra essence and thus breed a prodigy who could wield paragon power to greater effect than a regular \ophidian. 
These \quo{born paragons} gradually became a superior subrace, a ruling caste. 
They came to be known as \hr{Ophidian Imperial}{\emph{Imperials}}.

The \ophidian Imperials \hr{Ophidian immortality}{achieved immortality}. 





\subsubsection{Terrible elder world}
They were the most recent in a long line of civilizations on the planet. 
Almost like \humans in the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Compare to the people of Mu in \cite{HPLovecraft:OutoftheAeons}, who fear Ghatanothoa and other terrible gods and placate them with sacrifices. 

There were mountains and great basaltic pillars wherein dwelt the horrid \hs{flying polyps}. 
There were great areas that the \ophidians dreaded and learned to stay away from.
Even in their time of greatness they feared these relics of an elder age. 





\subsubsection{Wars against the Nibir}
For thousands of years the cruel \hr{Phaetonian}{Phaetonians} used the early \ophidians as slaves or hunted them for sport. 
But the \ophidians fought. 

The fledging \ophidian civilization waged bitter wars against the Nibir and eventually prevailed. 
They destroyed all Nibir and Phaetonians on \Miith. 

Compare this to the wars waged by humanity against the elder races in \cite{RobertEHoward:TheShadowKingdom}. 





\subsubsection[Wars against the Shugul]{Wars against the \moonthings}
\target{Ophidians drive out Shugul}
The \ophidians waged war against the \moonthings and their \moongods.
They destroyed the \moonthings' cities and drove them out.
Soon only the \moonthings' capital of \Nom was left.

Later \hr{Sethicus invades Nom}{\Sethicus invaded \Nom} and built his own temple-city of \Baltherium.





\subsubsection{Wars against the \noggyaleth}
\target{Ophidian-Noggyal wars}
\target{Noggyaleth lose a war before the FBW}
The \ophidians knew that the \noggyaleth existed. 
They did not know the \noggyaleth's true nature, although a few occultists suspected.
The \ophidians feared the \noggyaleth just as they did the \xss, but the \ophidian magic was mostly powerful enough to keep the chaotic, bestial \noggyaleth at bay or even destroy them.
In earlier days, the \ophidians waged great wars against the \noggyaleth and drove them underground.





\subsubsection{Early \ophidian culture}
\target{Early Ophidian culture}
The \ophidians developed culture and civilization early on, many millions of years before \Tiamat. 
But they had the infinite patience of reptiles, so \hr{Ophidians are slow}{they lived very slowly}, due in part to their \hs{torpor}.
Hence their culture also developed slowly. 

At first the \ophidians knew nothing of the \xss except vague legends handed down from prehistoric alien races. 
But they knew of various monstrous gods that dwelt on \Miith, such as \Ubloth. 
These \Miithian gods are comparable to the Great Old Ones of the Cthulhu Mythos, where the \xss are comparable to the Outer Gods. 
The \ophidians lived in fear of the ancient gods and worshipped them. 

They still knew little about the \xss. 
Only hints and myths.
What little they knew, they feared.
Only a few mad cultists worshipped them, and with little success.
\Sethicus was the first who was strong and brave and daring and heretic enough to \hr{Sethicus understands XS}{\emph{understand} the \xss}. 





\subsubsection{Lords of the Deep}
\target{Ophidians against Lords of the Deep}
The \hs{Lords of the Deep} had fought against the \moonthings. 
After the \ophidians had weakened the \moonthings, the Lords of the Deep returned, now more powerful. 
They conquered the planet and enslaved some \ophidians. 

The \ophidians fought back. 
They remembered that they had prevailed against elder races before. 
They vanquished the Lords of the Deep and cast them out, back into the deep sea. 
The \ophidians were now truly the rulers of \Miith. 





\subsubsection{Religion taboo}
After the \ophidians had won their freedom from the Nibir and other elder races, they promised to never again serve or worship a foreign race. 
They had developed a xenophobic distrust of other races after having fought genocidal wars. 
They pledged themselves to the dream of \ophidian supremacy:
The \ophidians should rule and bow to no masters. 

A strong cultural taboo arose. 
It was forbidden to worship anything as a god. 
The \ophidian culture was highly \hr{Ophidian philosophy}{atheistic}. 
It was held sacred that the \hs{Ouroboros}\dash the \caisith people\dash should serve no outsider, and preferably not keep outsider servants either. 

Hence they \hr{Enslaved Ophidian subraces}{created their own \ophidian subraces and enslaved them} instead of employing servitor races. 
Only millennia later, when this taboo had withered away, \hr{Origin of Scathae}{were the \scathae created}. 

They also established a taboo against certain types of sorcery. 
\Sethicus would later challenge that taboo. 





\subsubsection{Ouroboros}
\target{Ouroboros}
The \caisith created the Ouroboros \nexus to make themselves independent of foreign gods. 
The \nexus would safeguard their souls after death and allowed them to wield powerful magic. 










\subsection{Golden age}
\target{Ophidian Golden Age}
\target{Ophidian golden age}
\target{Ophidian civilization}
\index{technology!\ophidian}
The \ophidians{} built a civilization which was great, mighty, proud, enlightened and technologically advanced. 



\lyricstitle{\emph{Call of Cthulhu} RPG p.118}{
  [The Serpent People] built black basalt cities and fought wars, all in the Permian aera or before. 
  They were great sorcerers and scientists, and devoted much energy to calling forth dreadful \daemons{} and brewing potent poisons.

\citeauthorbook[p.44--45]{ClarkAshtonSmith:UbboSathla}{Clark Ashton Smith}{Ubbo-Sathla}{
  At length, after aeons of immeroial brutehood, it became one of the lost serpent-men who reared their cities of black gneiss and fought their venomous wars in the world's first continent.
  It walked undulously in antehuman streets, in strange crooked vaults; it peered at primeval stars from high, Bebelian towers; it bowed with hissing litanies to great serpent-idols.
}





\subsubsection{Interstellar civilization}
\target{High-tech civilization}
\target{interstellar civilization}
\index{technology!interstellar civilization}
The \ophidians built an interstellar civilization. 
Using magic and other science, creatures could travel between Realms and through the vastness of space to \cooperate, trade or wage wars. 

\Sethicus \hr{Sethicus brought innovation}{would later help expand this civilization}. 

They built colonies on other planets. 
Here they found remnants of extinct alien civilizations.
Some of the colonies, however, were destroyed when those remnants rose up in vengeance against the \Miithian interlopers.

There were also \hs{living machines}. 





\subsubsection{Wars against the \vorcanths}
After the victories \hr{Ophidians drive out Shugul}{against the \moonthings} and \hr{Ophidians against Lords of the Deep}{against the Lords of the Deep}, the \ophidians fought against the \vorcanths. 
The \ophidians wanted to colonize all the Realms of the system. 
The \vorcanths would not let them. 





\subsubsection{\Ophidian expedition to Visha}
\target{Ophidians invade Visha}
The \ophidians once tried to conquer Visha.
They fled in horror before the horrid and unfathomable \moongods. 
They abandoned the plan to settle Visha. 









\subsection{\Ophidians create subraces and servitors}
\target{Ophidians breed}
They had several entire races as their servants and slaves. 
And they controlled \daemons{}, whom they commanded to build their great cities. 

They learned bio-technology and biomancy. 
They started manipulating other races, breeding and tweaking them. 
They created their own servitor races and animals. 

That was the reason why, later on, there existed so many animal species on \Miith{} that could be domesticated: 
The \ophidians{} had been breeding them, millions of years before. 

Among other things, they helped shape the \hr{Nycan}{\nycans}. 
They also \hr{Ophidians create Nephilim}{created the \nephilim as slaves}. 





\subsubsection{\Ophidian subraces}
\target{Enslaved Ophidian subraces}
The \caisith made several genetically engineered subraces, especially of the Worm caste.
These \caisith variants were mostly enslaved and subjugated. 

Compare to the thunder warriors and astrotelepaths of \emph{Warhammer 40,000}. 





\subsubsection{\Ophidians create \nephilim}
\target{Ophidians create Nephilim}
Perhaps the \ophidians bred the \nephilim as slaves.
The \nephilim would remain slaves until \hr{Origin of Aryothim}{the advent of the \aryothim}. 





\subsubsection{Dreadnoughts created}
The \hr{Dreadnought}{Dreadnoughts} were created. 
They were biomechanical war machines in the shape of gigantic reptiles. 
They were created to fight against the \vorcanths and other enemies of the \ophidians.
And also used in wars between \ophidian nations. 















\subsection{Ramarxes and the Concord}
\target{Concord}
\index{Concord}
\hs{Ramarxes} was a genius \caisith inventor and entrepreneur. 
His great invention was the \emph{Concord}. 
The Concord was a telepathic union allowing all participants to communicate and remain in contact.
The Concord also functioned as a global repository of knowledge and data\dash a telepathic internet. 
A universal \caisith supermind. 

When the Concord was invented, it was quickly adopted and spread across the world. 
It strengthened the \caisith civilization.
It was revolutionary and ushered in a new golden age of marvelous progress and prosperity for the \caisith. 
It allowed them to build stronger \nexuses, so the paragon leaders could grow stronger. 
Ramarxes, as the inventor of the Concord, became the most famous and popular \caisith alive\dash perhaps ever (until \Sethicus). 
He was hailed as a genius and a benefactor\dash but he was also feared. 





\subsubsection{Inspired by Umaja}
Ramarxes had discovered the existence of \hr{Umaja supermind}{Umaja}, the supermind of the \hs{Greatest Race}. 
He had gleaned some insight from its tablets. 
It inspired him to create the Concord. 





\subsubsection{New Concord}
\target{New Concord}
Ramarxes kept developing and refining the technology of the Concord. 
He hungered for personal power and greatness, as did any ambitious \caisith. 
He wanted to be the greatest. 
So he developed \quo{deeper} Concord contracts, which individuals could then enter into (like license agreements). 
This enhanced set of Concord contracts was called the New Concord. 
Gradually, the New Concord became able to extract more and more information from individuals and influence their minds more and more.
More and more, the New Concord became a tool of mind control. 

The development of the Concord and the New Concord took centuries. 





\subsubsection{Ramarxes distrusted}
Ramarxes was not \apex of the entire Concord. 
(The rest of his people would never willingly agree to make him global \apex.)
There were other powerful \apexes, and some had a greater pyramid of vassals than Ramarxes did. 
So Ramarxes did not \emph{look} like the most powerful \caisith in the world.
But Ramarxes understood the Concord better than any other.
He knew many tricks and shortcuts.
So he had a lot of power he could abuse. 

From Ramarxes' perspective, his motives were pure. 
Ramarxes wanted to conquer the other races in the universe. 
He wanted the \caisith to rule the universe\dash and he wanted to rule the \caisith.
He wanted to be the greatest of all, as any self-respecting \caisith would. 
He wanted to be a god, the incarnation of the soul of the \caisith race and their \hs{dweomer}. 

Gradually Ramarxes began to draw on the resources available to him.
It dawned on the rest of the population that Ramarxes was growing more powerful.
By this time the entire \caisith civilization was built around the Concord.
It was virtually impossible to \quo{opt out}. 





\subsubsection{War against Ramarxes}
More and more, people began to distrust Ramarxes. 
Other leaders banded together and demanded that Ramarxes relinquish power.
Ramarxes contended that he was not holding any unlawful power, and that there was nothing to relinquish.

Others began to actively attack Ramarxes and try to force him to relinquish power.
Ramarxes fought back with the weapons at his disposal. 
In doing so, Ramarxes \quo{tightened} the New Concord and utilized its potential for mind control. 
The more Ramarxes fought, the more people began to fear him.
Battle lines were drawn. 
Boundaries were crossed.
It came to war. 

Ramarxes became afraid. 
Afraid of losing everything he had built.
Afraid of being destroyed. 
So he began taking drastic measures.
He delved into dark sorcery. 
As the master of the Concord, he had access to vast resources of knowledge, so he was able to reconstruct ancient outlawed sorceries and perfect them further. 
He descended into darkness. 
And with his power over the New Concord, he dragged the minds of the \caisith race with him down into darkness. 

Horror reigned. 
Many \ophidians succumbed to madness\dash and their madness unleashed alien horrors upon the world. 





\subsubsection{Fall of Ramarxes}
Ramarxes' empire was crumbling, and enemies were at his very door, coming to slay him. 

In his desperation, Ramarxes reached out into the great void searching for power.
He looked to the Umaja Tablets. 
This drove him mad. 

When his enemies found him, Ramarxes was a wretch. 
He was in total despair. 
He laughed madly and made no effort to save himself. 
They slew him. 





\subsubsection{\Sethicus kills Ramarxes}
\target{Sethicus kills Ramarxes}
The team of champions sent to slay Ramarxes included Valcan (\hr{Sethicus}{\Sethicus}) and the parents of \Nexagglachel, \Iscrafel and \Secherdamon. 
Perhaps Valcan delivered the killing blow. 





\subsubsection[Tyrasshana gets Ramarxes' records]{\Tiamat gets Ramarxes' records}
\target{Tiamat get Ramarxes records}
\Tiamat got hold of some records from Ramarxes and his inner circle describing their vision for the Concord and their pain and frustration and sorrow because so many condemned them and tried to destroy them with violence.

At the time\dash after Ramarxes' fall\dash Ramarxes was unpopular.
It would be dangerous to \Tiamat's career (and perhaps her life) to be seen as a Ramarxes sympathiser, so she kept these records secret and told no one that she was reading them. 
She began to greatly respect Ramarxes and came to share his utopian vision. 

























\section{\Sethicus and his research}
\Sethicus was an \ophidian polymath.
He was controversial because he delved into sorceries \hr{Ophidians and XS}{which the \ophidian{} establishment frowned upon}. 







\subsection{Technology and \Sethicus's innovation}
\target{Sethicus brought innovation}
When the \dragons were created, the \ophidians had only begun to build an \hs{interstellar civilization}. 
So the \dragons had only limited knowledge of the \ophidian super-technology.
The \dragons and \ophidians would both continue to develop their knowledge in the coming millennia, but in different directions. 

The \ophidians were generally \hr{Ophidians are slow}{long-lived, slow-living and slothful}, so they developed new ideas only slowly. 
Hence \hr{Early Ophidian culture}{their culture lasted for millions of years}.

\Sethicus's time was characterized by very fast development. 
\Sethicus was a very impatient and ambitious \ophidian.
He craved more than his race's slow, complacent lifestyle.
He craved action, excitement and renewal.
He was a great scientist who made many inventions.
He inspired many followers to live fast like him. 
In those decades and centuries, technology developed just as quickly as it might for a short-lived race.

\Sethicus himself was a brilliant scientist and made many exciting new discoveries in various fields. 
Later in his life, he became preoccupied with alienist sorcery.
This came to dominate his life and career. 

\Sethicus was a primus motor when it came to pushing the boundaries of space travel and establishing an interstellar \ophidian empire. 
Before him, they had been a spacefaring race for millennia, but rarely ventured beyond their solar system, and they had done no colonization beyond the occasional research station in the solar system. 
\Sethicus made them found settlements on many planets and moons in the solar system and even beyond it, and they began terraforming processes. 





\subsubsection{Energy sources}
\target{Draconian energy sources}
\Sethicus's society required colossal amounts of energy to sustain it.
To procure enough energy they used dark spells to draw energy from the void and the Heart, and they sacrificed vast numbers of humanoids to feed their machines. 

\Sethicus himself helped build this network of power plants.
He used complex black spells which only he fully understood to suck even more energy from the dying universe so it could fuel his \hr{Sethicus plan}{masterplan}. 

Compare to the Immortal Emperor and the Astronomican in \cite{RPG:Warhammer40000}, which requires the sacrifice of countless \humans daily to sustain them.









\subsection[Sethicus and Tyrasshana]{\Sethicus and \Tiamat}
One of \Sethicus's more important allies was \hr{Tiamat}{\Tiamat}. 

Originally she was his assistant and servant.
She followed him around on his journeys and learned much. 





\subsubsection[Tyrasshana's]{\Tiamat's motivation}
\Tiamat wanted to make the world a better place, lift her people out of warfare and strife, oppression of Worms and all-round suffering.
She saw the existing \ophidian oligarchy as decadent and corrupt. 
She saw the dystopia of the \hr{Enslaved Ophidian subraces}{enslaved \caisith subraces} and wanted to change it.
She wanted to seize power and achieve \quo{great things} (whatever that meant). 









\subsection{Discovering the \xss}
\target{Sethicus maps the way to Machai}
\target{Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers}
\Sethicus-tachi discovered the \xss{} from some ancient ruins\dash perhaps left behind by the \voyagers. 
Together they charted the cosmic paths leading to \Machai, the \xzaishannic{} homeworld that had been lost after the fall of the \ophidians. 
(These are some of the same paths that Chaos sorcerers would use millennia later.)





\subsubsection{\Ophidian origin}
\target{Sethicus discovers Ophidian origin}
It had been theorized that \hr{Ophidian parentage}{the \ophidians were descended from \xss}. 
It was \Sethicus who really understood the connection. 
He theorized that the \ophidians were related to the \xss.
Perhaps even created by them, or at least evolved from creatures created by them.
\Sethicus believed they had been \hr{Sethicus believes Ruin Satha created Ophidians}{imparted hunger/will/motivation by \RuinSatha, and then physical life by \KhothSell}. 
And he shaped his beliefs into mystical theories that could be used to cast magic. 

\citeauthorbook[p.16]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  A sliver of this transcendent black essence dwells in the darkest part of man's being.

\subsubsection{Voyage of discovery}
They explored the cosmos, looking for illumination and arcane knowledge. 

\lyricslimbonicart{Dynasty of Death}{
  I'm launching into the abysmal universe.\\
  Disembodied I enter the cosmic cataclysm.

  A nemesis for all evil I confess.\\
  My soul bleeds by all the forces I possess\\

They learned the grim truths and secrets of the universe. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers}{

\lyricsbalsagoth{Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers}{

\lyricsbalsagoth{Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers}{

She discovered a wealth of cosmic knowledge, comparable to the Sith library in the game \emph{Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}. 
Also comparable to the tale of the Empyreal Lexicon by Bal-Sagoth.

\Sethicus was excited.
He was beginning to learn the ancient spellwords that would later become known as the \TrueDraconic tongue.

\subsubsection{\XzaiShanns slept}
At \Sethicus's time, the \xss had long been very deep in their sleep. 
As a consequence, the \Miithians had all but forgotten them. 
Many \ophidians did not believe they existed, and they did not believe that magic (in the form \Sethicus proposed) was even possible. 

But the \xss had begun to stir ever so slightly.
Thus \Sethicus was able to discover them and learn some of their secrets and make pacts with them so he could cast magic. 
\Sethicus became the founder of alienist magic.





\subsubsection{The keys to insight}
In order to summon the \xss{} and invoke their power, \Sethicus-tachi discover that they must find a number of \quo{keys}. 
After a while of searching they finally realize that the \quo{keys} are not physical objects but insights. 

They are told that some of the keys must be captured from their rival races. 
They only manage to do this when they realize that what they are supposed to steal/conquer is knowledge, not artifacts.

The part about \quo{in the beginning} refers to the idea that \hr{Ophidians related to XS}{their pre-history is connected to the \xss}. 










\subsection{Worshipping the \xzaishanns}
At first, \Sethicus and his fellows retained the \ophidians atheism and merely consorted with the \xss. 
Later they began to admire them more. 
As time went on, they became addicted to the power that the \xss could bring, and the began to worship them in earnest.

\subsubsection{\XzaiShanns would soon rise}
\target{Sethicus believed XS would soon rise}
\Sethicus knew that the \xss were slightly more awake now than they had been for many ages.
In the beginning he interpreted this to mean that the \xss would soon arise and reconquer the world. 
Later he realized his error and revised his theories accordingly. 
It turned out the \xss were not at all about to rise. 





\subsubsection{\Sethicus understands the \xss}
\target{Sethicus understands XSS}
At this time the \ophidians still knew little about the \xss. 
Only hints and myths.
What little they knew, they feared.
Only a few mad cultists worshipped them, and with little success.
\Sethicus was the first who was strong and brave and daring and heretic enough to \hr{Sethicus understands XS}{\emph{understand} the \xss}. 

In order to do this he needed to understand the truth about the \hs{dead universe}, which was an indescribably awful truth that the \ophidians dared not face or even contemplate, even though their occult philosophy and science had by now given them sufficient hints to suspect it. 

This \emph{understanding} was something \Sethicus needed.
Only then could he begin to truly draw on the power of the \xss.
Only then could he envision the \TrueDraconic tongue and map out the \draconic theory of magic.







\section{\Sethicus (\yds{Sethicus creates Dragons})}
\subsection{\Dragons are created}
\target{Origin of Dragons}
\target{Sethicus creates Dragons}
\Sethicus became the first \dragon.
\Tiamat become the second.

\target{Dragons use Dreadnoughts}
Using their advanced gene-technology and psychometabolism and \Sethicus's \xsic{} sorcery, they designed a race of \ophidian{} super-warriors. 
They fused their own \ophidian bodies and minds with those of mighty \hs{Dreadnoughts}, infused with all the \xsic{} ferocity they could conjure up. 
A number of \ophidian{} warriors volunteered to be transformed into these new superbeings. 

When the experiments where at last successful, the result was huge, flying monsters: 
\Dragons. 

The \dragons were the first \hs{True Immortals}. 

The \dragons{} enslaved legions of \daemons{} that previously served the \xzaishanns. 
They turned their gaze on \Miith{}, bent on conquest.

\lyricsbalsagoth{The Voyagers Beneath the Mare Imbrium}{
  My power is absolute\prikker greater even than that of Angsaar himself!\\
  I shall crush the Tellurian sphere,\\
  and the flaccid lickspittles who strive in vain to safeguard it!\\
  Yes\prikker The dreaming is over!\\
  Now, let the vengeance begin!}

This newfound power corrupted them into chaotic, \daemonic{} beings. Twisted by the \xzaishannic{} souls within them, they almost became \xzaishanns{} in \ophidian{} form. 





\subsubsection{\Tiamat was the founding mother}
\Tiamat became the founder of the \draconian race.
She had a vision of a race of mighty super-\ophidians.
She convinced \Sethicus to help her in this endeavour.
Later ages would remember \Sethicus as the father of the \draconian race, but it was actually chiefly \Tiamat's project.
(The \dragons of later days did not like to remember \Tiamat because of \hr{Tiamat mutates}{the monster she later became}.)





\subsubsection{\Dragons lose much in the transition}
The \dragons gained much wisdom, power and pleasure when they became \dragons. 
But they also lost much of their sanity, humanity, gentleness and the calm, rational philosophical disposition that \hr{Ophidian philosophy}{had been their trademark}. 

In a sense it was a fall from grace. 
But only very few \dragons saw it this way. 
\Iurzmacul and \Nexagglachel were pretty much the only ones. 
Only much later would \Ishnaruchaefir come to share their views.





\subsubsection{Later someone discovers it}
Later in the series, I should have a story arc where someone discovers the truth of \Sethicus-tachi and their research. 

\lyricsbalsagoth{Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers}{
  \prikker a fantastic and somewhat 
  horrifying dream in which I traversed a great black cyclopean cityscape,
  its towering stygian walls inscribed with some form of outlandish glyphs which
  seemed to writhe squamously and alter their shape even as I gazed at them.
  \\
  A sibilant whispering which seemed at once familiar and yet intrusively alien
  compelled me to walk to the edge of a particularly sinister looking edifice
  and peer out over its precipitous perimeter. 
  \\
  When I did so, I beheld this
  world of ours, recognizing vaguely the apparent shapes of the five continents,
  yet the entire vista seemed so distant that the whole appeared in its entirety
  no larger than a sphere which I could fit snugly into the palm of my hand.
  \\
  When I turned again to behold the looming obelisks, I found I could then
  easily read the previously untranslatable ciphers in the black stone. 
  \\
  They
  were the words of a great thaumaturgist who had seemingly discovered a
  repository of aeons-old lore detailing the sidereal web of the cosmos, with
  arcane diagrams pinpointing certain astral portals and places of empyreal
  potency, a sort of pangalactic ley-line chart, if you will. 
  \\
  Indeed, these
  Star-Maps of the Ancient Cosmographers seemed to take a not insignificant 
  toll on the author's sanity, as evidenced by the tone of his inscriptions, which
  seem to suggest that in discovering this Pandora's Box of dark elucidation,
  his fate was to be inexorably dogged by some nameless and implacable gloom
}









\subsection{Some see the \xss{} as evil}
Some \ophidians{} see the \xss{} as a terrible evil that must not be allowed into the world. 

\lyricsauthorbookpage{Graham McNeill}{False Gods}{157}{

  All is grim darkness and all is war. \\
  Only you have the power to stop this future. \\
  You must be strong, Warmaster. \\
  Never forget that.
}












\subsection{War against the Gods Beneath}
Perhaps the \hs{Gods Beneath} awoke and attacked the \ophidians at this point. 
This was just when \Sethicus and his cohorts were achieving enlightenment. 
\Sethicus and his \dragons rose up and defeated the Gods Beneath.









\subsection{Rebellion}
\Sethicus and his \dragons rebelled against the other \ophidians. 

The war song of the \dragons: 
They revelled in their power and fury, their ability to cause destruction and fear.

The \firstgendragons{} waged war against their fellow \ophidians{}\prikker and the world.

\HesodNerga{}, the great \ophidian{} hero, protested against his daughter's embracing this thoroughly evil power.

\subsubsection{Religion}
The rebellion was religious in character. 
\Sethicus and his cohorts fought for their mystic beliefs.
His opponents fought for their materialistic, atheistic beliefs and saw \Sethicus as a dangerous fanatic and madman. 

\citeauthorbook[p.80--82]{VengerSatanis:CthulhuCult}{Venger Satanis}{Cthulhu Cult}{
  Only the cosmic horror that comes from the worship of oozing, malevolent monsters from vast and sprawling dimensions can set man on the right path.
  The Old Ones are the road to madness, destruction, and truth.
  
  Endarkenment is the opposite of enlightenment.
  The light strives to make the illusion real. 
  In darkness, Cthulhu Cultists shall have reality naked and exposed. 
  
  \prikker
  
  Purification will begin when the Cult of Cthulhu has taken over the world.
  Those who are biologically closer to the Old Ones will fully transform into their accurate conformation.
  That which was \human shall be cleansed; the eldritch beast is resurrection from the shadow that has learned to walk in Hell.
  The demonic soul is freed!
  
  \prikker
  
  Respect the laws of your land until the apocalypse begins.
  When Cthulhu Cultists number in the thousands, the balance of power will begin to shift.
  When the stars align, our bilious green and slimy inquisition shall be unleashed. 
  Death to all who oppose us!
