\target{Mephilex' initiation story}
\index{Innermost \Arcana, The}
This short story tells the back-story of \hs{Suthis Mephilex}. 















\section{Summary}









\subsection{Mephilex must learn \arcana}
At the beginning of this story (or another story), Mephilex was young and ignorant.
She was 26 years old. 
As per the traditions of the \Yormissian \rethyaxes she had spent her first thirteen years learning basic skills such as literacy, mathematics and meditation, and her next thirteen years mastering the first six \hr{Arcana}{\arcana} and their spells. 
Now she was ready to learn the True \Arcana that lay beyond the basic \arcana. 
She was ready to descend further through the \hs{Dreaded Gateways}. 
She must also learn the secrets of her family and what went on in the hidden lodge halls in cellars beneath \Yormis. 

She must learn the three \hr{Suthis Innermost Arcana}{Innermost \Arcana of the Suthis clan}.

The story should start like \cite{RobertBloch:TheSecretintheTomb}, with the reader learning that Mephilex was a descendant of a line of sorcerers.






\subsubsection{Mephilex remembers Dristan}
\target{Suthis Dristan dies}
Mephilex had an older cousin, \hs{Suthis Dristan}. 
He was also a \rethyax and had had to learn these same revelations that Mephilex now faced. 

Dristan proved not strong enough.
The revelations drove him insane, so insane that he died of fright.
Mephilex remembered well the time of her cousin's death.
She had been close to him, and the loss of him struck her hard.
Especially because she knew she must one day go through the same trials.
It made her sick to think about it.
She remembered how all food and drink seemed to taste sickly for weeks after Dristan's death. 
That was how bad she felt.

Shortly after Dristan's death Mephilex had been given a special dish, allegedly made from the flesh of a mosca. 
She later remembered that every time she had had mosca, at night she would have strange nightmares. 
She would see \Ubloth.
There would be horrid slime everywhere. 
Sometimes she would be immersed in the slime.
Sometimes it was as if the slime was inside her, pumping through her veins.
It was as if she drowned in the slime, was absorbed by it, became one with the slime. 
It was in her and she was in it. 

\citeauthorbook[p.45]{HenryKuttner:TheBlackKiss}{%
  Henry Kuttner%
}{%
  The Black Kiss%
}{%
  And in that kiss strangeness flooded him.
  He felt a shock and a tingling go through him, and then a sthrill of sudden ecstasy, and swift on its heels came horror.
  Black loathsome foulnees seemed to wash his brain, indescribable but fearfully real, making him shudder with nausea.
  It was as though unutterable evil were pouring into his body, his mind, his very soul, through the blasphemous kiss on his lips.
  He felt loathsome, contaminated.
  He fell back.
  He sprang to his feet. 
}





\subsubsection{Mephilex meditates}
The evening before her initiation, Mephilex sat and meditated. 
She felt a colossal formless power stirring, like a humongous living thing far down in the deep. 
She woke, and it was as if she could physically feel the stone tower quake underneath her, as if shaken by some thing moving far beneath.
She imagined she could hear a spectral groaning from underground.
But she convinced herself that she was just imagining it. 

Later in the story she would feel these reverberations again. 
But every time, when she looked around, it was as if only she could feel it. 

The reason was that her family had been feeding her the slime of \Ubloth for weeks, and they had been feeding her blood to \Ubloth, so the two were already forming a metaphysical bond. 









\subsection{The secret of the \ophidians}
Mephilex's father, \hs{Suthis Cruan}, was her mentor and guide.
He, together with other \rethyaxes, took her down into the deep. 
She saw the marvellous and sinister underground city. 

They took no guards with them, but as they descended further down Mephilex could see furtive shapes creeping in the darkness around them.
They were \hr{Suthis monster slaves}{the clan's monstrous half-\scathaese slaves}. 
She was afraid, but Cruan told her not to worry.
They were not enemies.
The creatures were here to protect and escort them.
She would soon see them up close.
Mephilex did not look forward to that.
The creatures were awful.
Hideously \scatha-like, and yet alien.
Monstrous.
Misshapen. 

It was very dark down here. 









\subsection{The Master}
\target{Mephilex is supposed to meet the Master}
Her father told her that she was to meet the \quo{Master}, the mysterious non-\scathaese lord that ruled the underworld of \Yormis.
This Master was really \hr{Ishtacca}{\Ishtacca}, the eldest \ophidian lord. 

Cruan (or another wise \scatha) told her that the Master and his people had dwelt in darkness for a million years and learned to live without light. 
That was why the city was so dark.

Make it clear that the Master was \emph{not} \Ubloth. 

Mephilex was shocked and repulsed by the sight of the half-\scathaese guard-slaves.
She was also scared by the \ophidian sarcophagi.

The Master was just about to possess a slave body (\hr{Ophidian possession}{as \ophidians did}) so he could talk to her.
Then the enemies attacked. 
They killed the slave body, dispelling the Master. 










\subsection{The secret of cannibalism}
Mephilex learned another horrifying secret: 
Her cousin \hr{Suthis Dristan}{Dristan} had not \hr{Suthis Dristan dies}{died on his own}, but had been killed by his family. 
Worse, they cut up Dristan's body, cooked it and fed it to Mephilex. 
Over the course of several weeks they made her eat all his flesh and drink his blood and fluids. 
That way his body did not go to waste. 
He was full of invaluable genetic material which must be preserved for the good of the bloodline.
He had been their prime scion, but now he had failed, and now Mephilex was their greatest hope.
They prepared his body with powerful spells and made her eat him so that she would inherit the power and purity in his veins. 
They even bound his very soul in his flesh and made her ingest it. 
That way he would live on through her. 

Mephilex was horrified to learn this. 
But later she accepted it.
She began to feel the closeness of Dristan's soul.
She could feel him inside her head, whispering to her.
At first this horrified her, but she learned to accept it.
She realized that she had not lost her beloved cousin.
He was still with her.
It was up to her to triumph where he had failed.
Her family expected it of her.
Dristan expected it of her.
She came to look to Dristan's ghost as a source of strength. 
She took comfort in it, and in the dark marvels of her clan. 

Compare to the main character in \cite{HPLovecraft:TheShadowOverInnsmouth}, who in the end learns to love and embrace his Deep One legacy.









\subsection{The secret of \Ubloth}
Mephilex was now ready for the third \arcanum: 
That \hr{Suthis and Ubloth}{the Suthises worshipped \Ubloth}, and that \hr{Suthis souls and Ubloth}{their souls were bound to \Ubloth}. 

Mephilex had not yet made a pact with any god. 
Her family forbade it. 
So her magic was still weak and immature.
She would soon learn why:
She was to enter into a pact with \Ubloth, her ancestral patron god. 









\subsection{Enemies attack}
But the Suthises had enemies. 
Mephilex herself had a mortal enemy in a rival clan. 
These enemies knew about the subterranean city, for there were other clans than Suthis that served the \ophidian \liches.  
Now, while Mephilex was being guided through her \arcana, the enemies attacked.
They wanted to assassinate Cruan and Mephilex while they were preoccupied and off their guard. 
And they wanted to do it down here in the deep where no one would ever know (for the existence of the underworld city was a secret from the public). 

The enemies attacked.
They killed several.









\subsection{Mephilex flees into the tunnels}
Mephilex was separated from her father and their guards and forced to flee for her life into the dark tunnels below. 
She had only heard half of the story and knew only bits and pieces about \Ubloth, not nearly enough to piece together the awful truth. 
But now, running blind through the black corridors, she stumbled on hidden altars, statues, inscriptions, laboratories and notebooks.
And on one occasion she lay hidden in a corner and listened to her enemies as they walked by her.
And she found evidence that her family sacrificed flesh and souls to \Ubloth. 

She also began to hear the voice of Dristan in her head. 
At first she fled from him and tried to shut him out.
But she realized that he was helping her, and she slowly accepted him as an ally. 
He helped her realize the truth. 

She had a scroll containing the spell she was to use to make the pact with \Ubloth.
Her father had given it to her along with strict orders not to open it until the right time came. 

From all these clues she slowly pieced together the truth.
She realized that her family served some hidden god named \Ubloth that had its shrine in the deeps. 
She realized that she had to make a pact with this god in order to gain her full power. 





\subsubsection{Mephilex encounters horrors}
Mephilex encountered horrors. 
She met awful undead slaves that went about their silent business.
They did not harm her and indeed completely ignored her, but she was still deathly afraid of them. 
She also saw living buildings, and she saw undead monsters and undead buildings that used to be alive. 









\subsection{Into \Ubloth's chamber}
Then she was chased into the deepest central chamber (or cavern).
Here she laid eyes upon the seething, bubbling pit of pure vileness and filth that was \Ubloth. 
She remembered Dristan's cries when he went mad.
He raved about \quo{the amorphous god}. 
She realized that this abomination was \Ubloth. 
This was the god that she was destined to serve. 
A hideous thing of slime that was fed with the flesh and souls of mortals. 
She screamed and cried. 

Her enemies came after her.
Self-preservation took over, and she fought to defend herself.
She managed to hide in a place where her enemies could not easily come at her.
This gained her a respite.
But she realized that she had to act fast. 
She could not fight her enemies.
She was too weak.
She was not yet a full \rethyax.
She realized what she must do: 
She must make her pact with \Ubloth, here and now.

She realized that she had been drinking the effluvium of \Ubloth for weeks, and \Ubloth had been drinking her blood. 
She was already inexorably bound to the loathsome god, whether she liked it or not.
She felt that she had no choice. 
She must bond with \Ubloth.

Fortunately she had the scroll.
She opened it and began the spell. 
She finished the spell and felt \Ubloth's filth seep into her mind. 
And she felt all the souls contained within \Ubloth; those who had given themselves to it, and those whom it had consumed. 

Mephilex had realized the nature of her clan's \hr{Suthis and Ubloth}{horrid symbiosis with \Ubloth}.
She knew she had been eating humanoid flesh and imbibing their souls, and that \Ubloth had been fed her blood, and that she had then been fed \Ubloth's effluvium. 
Finally Mephilex gave herself up to \Ubloth. 
She stepped or leapt into the pool.
She surrendered herself and let \Ubloth flow around her and into her and feed.
In return \Ubloth filled her with sorcerous power. 

Now filled with the power of \Ubloth, Mephilex immediately used it to cast a spell.
She drew energy directly from \Ubloth's body and blasted the minds of her assailants.
She then watched in horror as \Ubloth itself rose up to snatch and engulf her foes and drag them down into its slimy maw to devour their bodies and souls.
She shivered to think that it was she who brought this ghastly fate upon them.
And she shivered to think of the slavering inhuman evil of this loathsome shapeless thing which she is now forever pledged to serve, in this life and the next. 









\subsection{Aftermath}
Afterwards, Mephilex thought back to what happened. 
We hear that she later met the \quo{\hr{Mephilex is supposed to meet the Master}{Master}} and learned to love and worship him. 
Where \Ubloth was abhorrent, the Master was beautiful and splendid and terrible. 
He was not harmed when his host body was slain, for the Master was immortal.
He was the mightiest being in \Yormis save \Ubloth alone, for he is the messenger of \Ubloth and the eternal overlord of \Yormis. 
Praise the Master's name!

    1. Det er mig ikke helt klart hvordan personerne i din historie ser i
    den underjordiske by. Ja, der bliver nævnt fakler nu og da, men de
    syntes at være der allerede da personerne ankommer og i det første
    tilfælde bliver det ikke nævnt at de bliver tændt, og i den andet
    tilfælde kan det ikke være sket.

    Taler vi her om de klassiske evigt-brændende Hollywood Torches (som
    har brændt siden nogen var der sidste), eller er der tale om andet?

    Hovedpersonen kan i hvert fald ikke se i mørke, ellers giver følgende
    sætning ikke mening:
    "There were few torches, so soon I was crawling on my knees in
    pitch darkness through an inch-thick layer of goo."

    2. Nær slutningen af "The Natural Order" har du et "Blam!". Jeg syntes
    at dette er en øjenbæ, som sagtens kunne fjernes, så "The sound of a
    gunshot ripped through the air." står alene. Jeg syntes det ville give
    et bedre overblik.

    3. “Yuck! This tunnel is full of goo, and it stinks!”
    Denne sætning, i starten af sektion 6, er fuld af Narm. I forhold til
    den sindstilstand som hovedpersonen har, og som bliver vidregivet til
    os. Hvis du ikke kan/vil fjerne sætningen, så overvej i det mindste at
    fjerne den sidste del "...and it stinks", det vil gøre det meget
    bedre, og mindre ufrivilligt komisk.

    Ellers syntes jeg den er fin, godt gået.

  \changesitem{Worldbuilding}
    Mephilex should tell us what spells she is studying. 
    In her nightmare she passes some well-known milestones (see the section about \hr{Rethyax meditation}{\rethyax meditation}). 
    Then she is lost. 
    \Ubloth pulls her off her path and into its own clutches. 
    Later, when Mephilex throws herself into \Ubloth's embrace, she also passes through well-known stages of supernatural consciousness (albeit now on a more intuitive level, less analytical and controlled). 
  
    Mephilex mentions that the foundations were built by Suthis Ondra, her ancestor.
    (Add Suthis Ondra to the glossary.)
  
    Mention that the subterranean city is as old as Su-Gelba and Ibthek.
    Perhaps even so old that it was built while mythical \Aamon still stood (where now only the forbidding Tower of \Aamon stands).
    
    The underground temple where Cruan tells Mephilex about the \Arcanum of the Flesh is called the Shrine of the \hr{Uzul-Kaya}{\UzulKaya}.
    
    Make the reference to the war with the \banes more obscure, more vague.
    Just a hint. 
    
    Shorten the trip through the dead city. 
    
    When Mephilex prays to \Nasshikerr, she should not be speaking an easily understandable prayer.
    She recites the \hs{Lesser Shkormi Formula} in the name of the goddess \Nasshikerr who slithers unseen in the shadows.
    
    In the laboratory Mephilex finds a magical symbol that reminds her of the enigmatic and powerful Symbol of \Aamon.
    Some of the spells she sees are written in the language of \hs{Kush}.
    Mephilex knows no Kush, but she recognizes the curved sinuous script. 
    They are very different from the sharp angular \Draconic runes.

\chapter{The Master}
\target{Moro and Sperra story}
\target{Mephilex rises to power}
\index{Amorphous God, The}
The novel or novella tells the background story of \hr{Moro}{\MoroCobrel}.

\MoroCobrel and \TulionSperra were young mages in \hr{Yormis}{\Yormis}. 
They were lesbian lovers, with \Sperra as the dominant of the two. 















\section{Intrigue in \Yormis}
During Moro's time in \Yormis there was a big plot brewing.
Some factions fought against one another using ancient magic.
The Sentinels knew nothing of this whole thing and did not learn about it until it was over.
Sentinel resources were spread thin at this time, and they could not keep an eye on everyone.

A rebel faction, which included many \Ubloth cultists, had discovered the \hr{Mummies in Yormis}{crypt full of mummies} and wanted to resurrect them and thus gain an army of undead warriors and conquer the world. 

Another group, which included \hs{Suthis Mephilex}, wanted to stop them. 

\hr{Uldraan Kerross}{\UldraanKerross} was the most politically powerful mage in \Yormis at the time. 
He was horribly evil (read about him). 









\subsection{The Master}
The true ruler of \Yormis was the \ophidian lord \hr{Ishtacca}{\Ishtacca}, called the \quo{Master}. 
The story revolves around him.
Moro and Sperra heard tales of this mysterious and menacing \quo{Master}. 
They gradually discovered who the Master and his people were, and what they were doing in the dungeons below \Yormis.
They learned about the \ophidian quest for immortality.









\subsection{Suthis Mephilex}
A younger, up-and-coming mage of fine breeding and great talent was \hr{Suthis Mephilex}{Suthis Mephilex}. 




\subsubsection{Rise to power}
She wanted to oust \Uldraan and seize power for herself. 
But \Uldraan was still very powerful.
So Mephilex deftly manipulated various people into helping her defeat \Uldraan. 















\section{Sperra and Moro investigate}
\target{Moro and Sperra investigate Mephilex}
\Sperra and Moro suspected that Mephilex was up to something sinister.
They investigated. 










\subsection{Fighting or helping Mephilex}
They wanted to stop Mephilex's evil, but in reality they were being manipulated by Mephilex into helping her defeat her rival, \UldraanKerross. 

Moro started out inadvertently helping the rebels without knowing what they were up to.
Soon she switched sides. 
She helped Mephilex stop the rebels. 
Then Mephilex gained a lot of evil power and became one of the leaders of \Yormis. 

Moro was not quite happy about this. 
She did not trust Mephilex.
Moro feared Mephilex was evil.
She did not want her in power.
But she inadvertently helped Mephilex gain power.
Moro felt a bit guilty about this. 
She also feared she had done more harm than good in her attempts to save \Yormis.

Mephilex now planned to do the same thing as the rebel faction had planned to do.
Only somewhat different. 
She hoped to extract power from the mummies. 









\subsection{In the underground}
Sperra and Moro explored the dark caves underneath Mount \hr{Shrun}{\Shrun} near \Yormis.
They found the \hr{City beneath Yormis}{ruined underground \ophidian city}. 

Here they faced great danger and uncovered untold horrors. 
They saw glimpses of \hr{Degenerate Ophidians}{creeping degenerate \ophidians} and their servitors and monsters, but they were never sure exactly what they saw. 
There were also degenerate \scathae and \humans down there, \hr{Suthis cannibalism}{which were used a food} by the Suthis clan.  

They encountered undead in the underworld: 
\hr{Undead Ophidians}{\Ophidian mummies} and their zombie-like servitors.

They experienced ancestral dread.
Read about \hs{ancestral memory}.





\subsubsection{\Ubloth}
They found the great cavern-temple where lay the loathsome amorphous god \Ubloth. 
They saw the monstrous freaks that had been mutated by \hr{Effluvium of Ubloth}{\Ubloth's corrupting effluvium}.
In a climax of crowning horror they stumbled into the great hall and lay eyes upon \Ubloth itself.









\section{Sperra dies}
\target{Tulion Sperra dies}
\TulionSperra should be the main character and hero of this story.
More than once she risked her life and sanity to save Moro. 
In the end, \Sperra was killed and devoured by the god \Ubloth.
(This should come as a surprise for the reader.)

Moro many many mistakes and was clearly to blame for \Sperra's death.
Moro never forgave herself for this, and remained unhappy and guilt-wracked for the rest of her life. 
The only thing Moro could console herself with was that she had helped remove a gruesome tyrant and replace him with a somewhat milder tyrant. 
Moro only hoped that Suthis Mephilex's long-term evil plans would not prove her an even greater threat than \Uldraan was. 

After this incident, Moro left \Yormis. 
She had seen too many horrible things in the dungeons beneath. 
She wanted to get away from it all.
The whole city reminded her of horror and evil. 
She could not bear it anymore.

\chapter{\CarzainPrequelBook}
This book tells Carzain's back story, before he joined the Runger War. 
It details Carzain's travels, Vizicar's awakening and their joint path to \kenosis. 















\section{Overview}















\section{The Mutiny}
\target{Mutiny}
\target{Mutiny chapter}
Carzain and Nishain were betrayed by mercenaries in Heropond Forest. 
Vizicar awakened (for the first time in Carzain's life) and fought, killing the mutineers. 









\subsection{Old description}
Carzain goes to Martinum with his father. Then back.

It is only autumn as they travel through Heropond, but in the \Wylde it feels almost like winter: Hoarfrost lies on the ground, and cold mist fills the air.

The younger trees hate them and want the intruders out of their forest. Carzain finds an older tree that is indifferent, cold, uncaring\dash it knows that the humanoids will die soon enough anyway. 

(To what extent can Carzain read the thoughts of trees? Much of it is probably just guessing based on vague emotional impressions.)

He also sees the \hr{Moons}{moons} in the forest. They look spectral and spooky. Have some Bal-Sagoth-esque imagery about them.






\subsubsection{Carzain dreams of being nothing}
On the way back to \hr{Redglen}{\Redglen}, Carzain dreams \hr{Ramiel is nothing}{his recurrent nightmare of being nothing}. 

He sees visions of humongous gods: 
\Human-like, \dragons, amoebae with pseudopods\prikker





\subsubsection{Betrayed by mercenaries}
On the way back to \hr{Redglen}{\Redglen}, their hired guards mutiny against them. Carzain fights back using magic and suddenly feels a strange ecstasy, a possession. He fights with power he did not know he had and slays the thugs. He is puzzled by the possession experience. 

The magic should be more bloody. I should show how the skin blackens and seethes, let people scream their agony while they boil and burn. They get cramps and spasms and perform a sickly, morbid \quo{dance} before they die from being zapped. 

Maybe fire magic should cause the victim to burn up \emph{from the inside}, instead of just tossing fireballs. Or perhaps tossing fireballs is the beginner's tactic: Easier and cheaper, but less powerful and less accurate. Causing your victim to combust from within is harder, but much more deadly and accurate. It uses the victim's own life force as fuel, burning him to ashes. 

Describe how blisters boil and burst. 





\subsubsection{The Redcor discover the \vertexspike}
A Redcor \matron\dash\Esmerel?\dash is sitting in the Topaz \Chateau, performing divination though \index{aquamancy}. Insert some Bal-Sagoth imagery here. 

\lyricsbs{Bal-Sagoth}{A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria}{
  And in the dark ethereal mists of winter dreams,\\
  the ebon waters of enlightenment gleam 'neath the Black Moon,\\
  and the Valley of Silent Paths beckons\prikker
}

She discovers the \vertexspike{} that is caused by Vizicar's brief awakening, and realizes something has happened. I am not sure how much the Redcor know about \vertices, but she definitely knows something is up. She goes into research, and eventually they determine that very likely a Scion has awakened. 

\Esmerel{} goes off to wander the lands of \Velcad{} in search of the Scion. A year or so later she finds him, in the midst of the Pelidor-Runger war\prikker






\subsection{Changes}
The mercenaries have guns (pistols or muskets).

Maybe I should edit the date. 

Carzain and Nishain have not been to the Imetrium, merely some big port city in southern \Scyrum. 
They do not know so much Imetric. 
Nishain only knows a few rudiments, and Carzain none at all. 

When Vizicar fights, he ignores the \hr{Itzach pain}{pain that \Itzach{} brings}. 
\Itzach{} Vaimons have ways of using power economically, thus minimizing the pain and risk. 
Vizicar does not care about this. 
He is groggy and sleepy and his senses are dulled, so he thinks he is completely fresh and healthy and has plenty of bodily energy to spare. 
He does not want to be careful and conservative. 
He wants to be flamboyant and teach these damned peasants a lesson. 

After all, he is \VaimonCaliph. 
He is used to being one of the most powerful and skilled Vaimons in the \caliphate, and a Scion to boot. 
He does not stop to consider that he is out-of-touch with his body, or that his new body is weaker and less trained than his old one. 

Remember to have references to the \hr{Shechinah}{\shechinah}. 

After the battle, Carzain has nasty open wounds caused by drawing too much \qliphah{} power. 
He uses these heroic wounds to score Mirai. 
Then he gets healed by Imetric healers. 

The chapters with \ChyrieEsmerel{} and \LocarPsyrex{} do not happen at all. 
Get rid of them. 
At this point in time, no one knows about the \vertex. 
If they did, that would just cause all sorts of trouble and plot holes. 















\section{Ilcas Northstar}
\target{Ilcas Northstar chapter}
\target{Ilcas introduction}
Carzain and Nishain met Ilcas Northstar in \Bryndwin. 









\subsection{Old description}
Carzain and Nishain go back out of Heropond forest to the town of \Bryndwin.

\Bryndwin has its share of monuments (see section \ref{Monuments}): Poles with flags and lamps on them, carved images of gods, heroes and creatures, meant to scare the \Wylde and intruders away.

They encounter \hs{Telcastora Ilcas}, his two \nycans, Razor and Countess, and a bunch of other Imetrians. 

Remember to describe \hs{Telcastora Ilcas's appearance}.

They see a big \hr{Mulgron}{\mulgron}. Carzain is impressed by how the \mulgron is even bigger than an elephant. 

Remember to \hr{Nycans are frightening}{describe the \nycans as frightening and alien}.

Carzain reaches out his hand and tries to touch Razor's snout. Razor's eyes narrow slighty, and he retracts the hand. 

The two Vaimons hitch a ride back to \Redglen with Telcastora Ilcas and his Imetrians. Carzain befriends Ilcas and his \nycans, Razor and Countess. 

They part ways somewhere in Pelidor. 

Carzain has a wound from his battle with the thugs, but he suppresses the pain, as he doesn't want to show weakness in front on Telcastora Ilcas. I should try to portray him as somewhat over-proud and silly. 

During the trip back, he is treated by an Imetric healer-surgeon. But he retains the scars: One in his leg, one in the side of his stomach. 
The surgeon's treatment is more bloody than the Iquinian healing he is used to, but it is at least as effective. The Imetrians have a scientific approach to medicine, whereas the Redcor repress real science in favour of traditional mysticism. 
This makes Carzain doubt the value of Vaimon tradition.









\subsection{Changes}
Write about Carzain's meditation. 

Replace \quo{resonance} by \quo{\shechinah}.
Add \quo{\shechinah} to the glossary. 

\Bryndwin has a \hr{Wylde border}{\Wylde border} with charms and totem poles. 

Carzain introduces himself to Ilcas: 
\ta{I am \VizicarDurasRespina.} 

Ilcas carries a gun. 

When negotiating with the priest: 
Carzain has no interest in theology, but he is skilled at faking interest, if he does say so himself. 
It is a skill he has honed when picking up women. 

On their first day on the caravan, Carzain talks to Ilcas. 
Ilcas tells stories of his heroic and violent deeds, and of his heroic and violent sword. 
He especially tells of how he has fought against the Imetrium's arch-nemeses, the Rissitics. 
\hr{Rissitics and Runger}{This is important. The Rissitics are important to the story.} 
Make sure to paint the Rissitics as threatening and imposing foes.
Tell of how they wear animal masks and have warrior orders named Order of the \hr{Order of the Crocodile}{Crocodile} and Jackal and Scorpion and \hr{Order of the Hippopotamus}{Hippopotamus} and so on. 

These associations of war makes Carzain see visions of his past, but still very vague, little more than regular daydreams. 

Then Carzain asks to hold the sword. 
Ilcas refuses. 
But he shows him the sword and swings it around a bit himself. 
And tells him about it. 

Carzain scores Mirai faster (already on the first night) and more solidly. 
I need to show the reader how cool he is. 
He pulls off a pick-up comparable to the way Tony Stark scores the reporter girl in the movie \cite{Movie:IronMan}: 
\ta{I'd be willing to lose a few hours of sleep with you.}
She is impressed already after their very first meeting. 

Have more Vizicar in the sex scene with Mirai. 
And after it. 
He talks to Carzain in his head. 
Perhaps from Vizicar's POV. 

The night after sex, he lies awake thinking wildly about what in all of \Iquin and \Itzach is happening to him. 
When he falls asleep, he meets Vizicar in dreams. 

\target{Vizicar drives Carzain to war}
After this night, Vizicar drifts away. 
Carzain feels lost. 
Like something is missing inside him. 
Some important clue in some important mystery. 
Some part of himself. 
He feels like half a man. 

Carzain goes off to war hoping to find Vizicar again.  
He seeks out battle in the hope of provoking more Vizicar action in his head, so he can figure out who Vizicar is and what the deal is. 
Maybe Vizicar subconsciously imparts in him a desire to fight and seek glory. 
















\section{Visions and dreams}
Carzain had visions and dreams. 
As did Vizicar. 

They met in dreams and talked to one another, but neither understood what was going on. 
Both thought the other man was a figment of their own imagination. 

The dreams were triggered by combat and war, or the expectation of it. 









\subsection{Vizicar's motivation}
Vizicar knew he is more than a \human, and he told Carzain this. 
Vizicar wanted to attain \kenosis and regain his body, power and memory. 
Then he wanted to achieve \apotheosis and learn his true nature.
Then he would be a god.












\section{Carzain in the War}
\target{Carzain joins the army}
Pelidor went to war against Beirod. 
A trivial border dispute, but bloody enough. 

At this point, Carzain knew there was something odd going on with him. 
Carzain joined the army because he hoped it would help him find out what was happening to him, who he was and who Vizicar was. 
He could hear Vizicar stirring in his head at the prospect of war and glory: 

\begin{prose}
  \tho{I thought so. 
    It is this sort of thing that brings you out.
    \quo{Vizicar}.
    Whoever you are.
    I will find out what the deal is with you.
    And how I can get rid of you.}
\end{prose}







\subsection{War is Coming}







\subsubsection{Carzain joins the army}
News of the impending war with Runger reaches \Redglen. 

Carzain's parents hate war. Perhaps they have even done stuff to get him to dodge the draft - without his knowledge. Any any rate, Carzain goes to the barracks and signs up. See, Carzain is bored as fuck. He's a big boy in a small town. He has a craving for greatness, fame and power - things he cannot possibly find in \Redglen. He wants to explore and wants something to happen. So he goes off to war. At this point, Carzain is maybe 22. 

In the Pelidorian army, Carzain is welcomed because of his magical knowledge. Pelidor has few mages, since neither the Imetrium nor the Iquinian church support them. He is assigned to serve under Captain Archibald Curwen, the commander of the \ishrah of the Pelidorian army.  
Carzain also learns a lot of combat technique. As he studies combat, he finds all sorts of things coming naturally to him, as if he already knows them but has just forgotten he knew. 

On the way to \Malcur, Carzain calls dibs on a horse\dash a gray stallion named Arrow\dash rather than a \relc. Later, having trouble riding the beast, he ponders his decision. Seeing some of the others getting easily ahead on their \relcs, he realizes that a horse is not necessarily better. It is just that horses are more Vaimon-like. In stories, Vaimons always ride horses, so when he pictures himself in his head as a great Vaimon hero, he sees himself astride a horse, not a \relc or other reptile. Carzain realizes that he is a status-fixated snob. 





\subsubsection{Carzain and the Goldsmiths}
He talks to the Goldsmith brothers. 
He talks of how he is destined for greatness. 
At this point he remembers \hr{Ramiel dreams of being nothing}{his recurring nightmare of being nothing}, and he tries desperately to convince himself that he is not nothing. 
He tells himself that he is big and important, because he fears that dream. 









\subsection[To Malcur]{To \Malcur}
Carzain \travelled to \Malcur to join the Pelidorian \ishrah.

On the way he met Adrian Testor. 

In \Malcur he met Archibald Curwen. 

Have plenty of Vizicar scenes early on, including before, during and after his signing-up to the army. 
(If \quo{The Mutiny} and \quo{Ilcas Northstar} are kept in \TwilightAngelRememberEmph, then include lots of Vizicar scenes there. Otherwise move them to the prequel story about Carzain.)

Vizicar (when he gained some \kenosis) liked the life of an adventurer. 
It was a refreshing change of pace from the court life he was used to, full of responsibility and chains. 
This was a new kind of freedom, and Vizicar loved it. 





\subsubsection[Carzain meets Delph and Tsekkect]{Carzain meets Delph and \Tsekkect}
\target{Carzain meets Delph}
Carzain meets \hs{Delph} and \hr{Tsekkect}{\Tsekkect}.

They are cheerful guys. 
They befriend Carzain and show him around the barracks, where, among other things, Delph utters his classic line: 
\ta{%
  Life in the army is great. 
  We get food, money, a shot at glory, and the best pussy that money can buy. 
  Well\prikker the best pussy that \emph{our} money can buy, anyway.} 

To which Carzain replies: 
\ta{And all they ask in return is that we fight to the death.}






\subsubsection{Carzain's idealism}
At the beginning of the story, \hr{Carzain's idealism}{Carzain is quite idealistic}.





\subsubsection{Vizicar awakens a little bit}
At some time at the beginning of the war, before Carzain's first battle in the army, Vizicar surfaces a little bit. 









\subsection{To battle}
They go to battle the enemy. 





\subsubsection{Carzain and Delph practice with swords}
Carzain and Delph practice their swordsmanship. 

When the two duel, Carzain mostly loses. He knows some technique, taught to him by Sir Guy in \Redglen, and he is taller, which gives him a better reach. But the shorter and cruder Delph is faster and more agile, and he fights dirty. 

Carzain: \ta{You fight dirty, you know that?}

Delph: 
\ta{No, I just fight like a \meccaran. 
  That attitude of yours is just \human{} provincialism.}





\subsubsection{Carzain won't smoke}
Carzain hangs out with some soldiers. The others smoke some kind of strong drug, like hash or marijuana. 

\begin{prose}
  Soldier: \ta{Come on, \Shireyo, get over here and smoke.}
  
  Carzain: \ta{No, I don't touch that. It's filth.}
  
  Soldier: \ta{Why do you say that?}
  
  Carzain: 
    \tho{%
      Why \emph{do} I say that? 
      Because my father told me so, but I am not going to tell them that. Think, Carzain, think! 
      I can't lose face in front of these guys. 
      Say something witty.} 
    \ta{Something witty.} 
    \tho{Phew. Nicely salvaged, Carzain.}
\end{prose}





\subsubsection{Curwen and Carzain eat}
The officers of the Pelidorian army are eating a luxurious meal. This includes the \ishrah. 

Curwen: \ta{Ah, by \nieur, I love food.}

Carzain: \ta{Food is good, but I like sex better.}

Curwen: \ta{Meh. Most women cook better than they fuck.}

Both: \ta{LOL.}









\subsection{The \Caliph Inviolate}
The sortie encounters a small Rungeran force. They fight. 

Carzain fights and kills. 
But he is not as great a warrior as he fancies himself. 
So he gets clobbered and takes wounds. 

He calls out to Curwen-tachi for help. 
They save his ass. 

Then Vizicar awakens. 
It's due to a combination of factors: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item The pure rush of combat. 
  \item The anger and shame over being defeated in combat by such lowly grunts. 
  \item The wounds leave Carzain's own conscious mind weakened, making it easier for Vizicar to take over. 
\end{itemize}


% Recall that Carzain is a Scion, an incarnation of the \Malach{} Ramiel. 
% Occasionally, when he fights and kills, Ramiel awakens in him, and he hears the voice of \VizicarFull, the previous incarnation of Ramiel. (This is inspired by, and similar to, how Rand al'Thor in Wheel of Time hears the voice of Lews Therin Telamon. But where Lews Therin is mad, annoying and even dangerous, Vizicar is sane and a powerful ally.) 

% Anyway, Carzain fights and kills, and Vizicar comes along and takes over. 

Curwen immediately senses something fishy, probably a \vertexspike{}. 

This time there is a struggle between Carzain and Vizicar, as Carzain tries to get back in control of his own body. 

%After the battle, Carzain falls unconscious as Vizicar retreats. The prolonged, unaccustomed possession and the struggle between the two personas was too much for his consciousness to take. 

After the battle Curwen probes, prodding Carzain into telling him stuff. Carzain tells a little of what he knows, but it's not much. 

Carzain's body is in a bad shape. 
Vizicar is a harsh master and takes poor care of it. 
This is because Vizicar is only half-awake. 
He's still in a half-dreamy state, and his senses are weakened. 
He doesn't entirely register the pain, so he just pushes on. 
So after the fight Carzain is a useless wreck, barely conscious. 

Maybe Carzain asks the others: \ta{Did I save the da?} 

The others: 
\tho{Save the day? You crazy fuck, you nearly killed yourself, and maybe us, too.} 
\ta{Um, yeah. Sure. You saved the day.}

Delph is scared by Carzain's weirdness. Maybe insert an inner monologue with Delph about how Carzain is a crazy weirdo: 
\tho{Typically. 
     Finally I meet a guy who seems trustworthy, who might become a true friend, and turns out he is a madman. 
     Or possessed by \mdaemons{}, or whatever. 
     Huh. 
     That'll teach me to trust a sorcerer.}

During the fight, Carzan does something stupid and reckless. 
Perhaps he sees an enemy Vaimon and goes in to capture his sabre. 
Afterwards, Curwen bitchslaps him and scolds him: 
\ta{You crazy fuck, \Shireyo!
    What the fuck were you trying to do?
    You very nearly got yourself and the rest of us killed!}
He grabs Carzain by the collar. 
\ta{Let me tell you something, boy.
    Your insubordination stopped being charming a long time ago. 
    Now either you get in line or I'll have you beaten!}





\subsubsection{Vizicar dreams}
Have another scene that describes the battle from Vizicar's point of view. 










\subsection{Dark Crypts of the Mind}
Now that Vizicar is closer to the surface, Carzain begins to \hr{Ramiel dreams}{share his visions and nightmares}. 

He is haunted by the tortured, hateful faces of shackled ghosts. They show him their world: Cold, cruel, dreadful. They hate him and desire to drag him down into their prison\dash groping for him with their clammy, hideous hands. 

He awakens full of terror, and also a tinge of guilt. He has a feeling that he is somehow responsible for their torment. 

He also has vague dreams of lost greatness\dash \hr{Visualizing a matrix}{unconsciously visualizing} the \hr{Mystraacht Matrix}{\Mystraacht{} \matrix}. Feelings of having been betrayed, having lost his power and his memory, upon which his enemies descended upon his weakened self like vultures, usurping his rightful place and \honour and forcing him into flight and hiding. 
%, having his rightful place, power and \honour usurped

When he wakes he thinks about the whole thing. 
Part of him is horrified at the madness that is consuming him. 
But another part is excited. 
Because the possession brings \emph{power}. 
And a feeling of being destined for greatness and glory. 
This is what he has always dreamt of. 

But he has doubts. 
Maybe these feelings are fake. 
Maybe the possessing \Archon{} is brainwashing him, all the while making him feel like it is the right thing to do. 
Maybe he is being mentally deceived. 

But it still feels good. 

He thinks of the legend of \hr{Lestor}{Lestor \Delaen}. 
He dealt with \qliphoth{} despite everyone's advice. 
It was dangerous. 
He became a dark and controversial figure, but also a hero who achieved great things. 





\subsubsection{Carzain thinks more on his madness}
Part of him is horrified at the madness that is consuming him. 
But another part is excited.

Maybe move this to \quo{The \Caliph Inviolate}. 





\subsection{Vizicar}
Vizicar fights to gain control of his own body. 

\lyricsbs{Marduk}{Voices From Avignon}{
  Speak through me. Speak through me.\\
  The sin must be washed away with blood.\\
  Dream through me. \\
  Called to a new life through death.\\
  Called to a new life through death.\\
  But what shall you reach for when all \colours fall?\\
  Overwhelmed with maledictions. \\
  Feel the rays of redemption of a brand new Sun.
  
  Choking. Asphyxia. \\
  Inhale the Darkness, lungs filled up. \\
  Asphyxia. Asphyxia. \\
  But who shall you reach for when all \colours fall?\\
  Long-drawn moans and piercing cries \\
  blend with prayers and litanies. \\
  Faces bone dry. Condemned as the river everybody drank of. \\
  Inhale! Inhale!
}

\ta{I will win the power and glory I deserve. 
  Not just as \VaimonCaliph, but higher yet. 
  I am a Scion. 
  I am a \Malach. 
  I will achieve the \apotheosis{} and become one with \Iquin{} and \Itzach.
  That is my purpose as a Scion. 
  
  But first I must gain control of my own body. 
  Right now I live out an ignominious existence as a ghost in a boy's head. 
  I am nothing\prikker}

This makes him remember his nightmare of being nothing. 
He drifts away. 

He philosophizes. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{Sworn}{
  Four eyes as two in one.\\
  The forward circular view that never ends.\\
  An orbital voyage throughout the endless sphere of all,\\
  where time is lost and everything transcends.

  As ghosts to the world.\\
  Ghosts to the world.
  
  For ice, outside, are we apart.\\

  Ever floating on its course\\
  towards the heights of shadowland.\\
  
  Thus appear the truly sworn.
  
  To be seen.\\
  To be feared.\\
  Yet, not to be reached.
}





\subsubsection{Lost in the labyrinth}
He is trapped in the labyrinths of \itzach{}, lost and searching for those precious and ephemeral windows through which he can peer out through Carzain's eyes and affect the world through Carzain's body. 

\lyricsbs{Emperor}{Ensorcelled By Khaos}{

\subsection{Reads about Scions and Vizicar}
Maybe Carzain overhears someone (\Esmerel{} and \Racel{}?) talking about Scions. 
Maybe he is half-unconscious and they are standing over him, talking about him, trying to decide his future. 

He asks someone about the story of the Scions. 
Who? 
Perhaps \Racel, but more likely some other mage in the \ishrah. 
Perhaps \Sanyor. 

Anyway, he is told the story of the Scions. Or a version of it. Remember to have many false details, which can be brought into question later. 

Later, he goes into a library in \Forklin{} and reads about \VizicarDurasRespina. 
There isn't a big public library, but there are churches, and they have books. 
He goes into a church, introduces himself as an \ishrah{} mage and pulls a \trope{BavarianFireDrill}{Bavarian Fire Drill}.
He knows he has to use the same body language, frame control and social engineering skills that he masters when picking up women.
It works.
He gets his hands on the writings.

He also finds references to \hr{Vizicar's notes}{Vizicar's notes about \Malachim}, but can find no fragments of the notes themselves. 

He also finds references to \hr{Iolivine's notes}{\ps{\Iolivine} notes}. 
He has heard before that these notes are of exceptionally high quality, but he had been unable to find any copies of them. 
\hr{Redcor bogarted Iolivine's notes}{The Redcor are bogarting the notes}. 
This is one of the reasons he wants to go to \Redce. 

Among other things, he learns that \Belzir{} was an incarnation of an \quo{evil} \malach, and that she caused the \HundredScourges{} with her wicked \malach{} powers. 

More importantly, he learns that he is not mad. 
There are no \qliphoth{} controlling him. 
Instead, he is a Scion! 
He is an \uber-dude! 

He is happy. 









\subsubsection{Carzain reads about Scions}
Carzain is always researching what he is, always looking for more knowledge of Scions. 
He hopes it will lead him to \apotheosis. 

So he goes into a library in \Forclin{} and looks around. 
There isn't a big public library, but there are churches, and they have books. 
He goes into a church, introduces himself as an \ishrah{} mage and pulls a \trope{BavarianFireDrill}{Bavarian Fire Drill}.
He knows he has to use the same body language, frame control and social engineering skills that he masters when picking up women.
It works.
He gets his hands on the writings.

He also finds references to \hr{Vizicar's notes}{Vizicar's notes about \Malachim}, but can find no fragments of the notes themselves. 

He also finds references to \hr{Iolivine's notes}{\ps{\Iolivine} notes}. 
He has heard before that these notes are of exceptionally high quality, but he had been unable to find any copies of them. 
\hr{Redcor bogarted Iolivine's notes}{The Redcor are bogarting the notes}. 
This is one of the reasons he wants to go to \Redce. 

Among other things, he finds references to \Belzir. 
He already knows she was a Scion, allegedly an incarnation of an \quo{evil} \malach, and that she caused the \HundredScourges with her wicked \malach powers. 









\subsection{Why are you in my head?}
Somewhere along the way, Carzain-tachi get into a fight. Vizicar awakens. This time, after the battle Carzain falls unconscious. He dreams and meets Vizicar. 

He sees before his eyes a man who looks to be perhaps his father's age. 
But still strangely similar to himself. 
His complexion is much lighter, though. 
His long hair is blonde rather than black, and he wears a matching moustache. 

Carzain: \ta{Who are you?}

Vizicar: 
\vizicar{%
  Who am I? How can you not know who I am? I am \VizicarDurasRespina! The \caliph!}

Carzain: 
\tho{%
  \quo{\Caliph}\prikker is he the reason why that word has been popping up in my head?} 
(Maybe he doesn't think this until after he awakens from the dream-conversation.)

Carzain: \ta{Why are you in my head?}

Vizicar: \vizicar{Why are you in \emph{my} head?}

Carzain: \ta{I was here first.}

Vizicar: 
\vizicar{%
  Unless\prikker oh, \qliphoth\prikker unless I\prikker oh, by \iquin{} and \nieur. I must be dead.

  Yes, I remember now. Those vile worms killed me. \quo{Disease}, they called it. Hah!}

Carzain: 
\tho{%
  Fuck. 
  Not only is there a madman in my head, but now the madman is talking to himself!}

Carzain wonders what the deal is. 
How does this fit with the theory that it was the Midnight \Qliphoth{} that took control of him? 

Later, Vizicar apologizes to Carzain for putting him through Hell by his own recklessness, by ignoring the \hr{Itzach pain}{pain of \itzach}. 
Vizicar admits that he has been crazy and has fucked their body up.

    This might be the place where Carzain introduces himself:

    Again, Vizicar ignores the \hr{Itzach pain}{pain of \Itzach}, and Carzain gets burnt and wounded as a result.

    Curwen needs to tell the reader that the \ishrah{} mages are equipped with plate \armour. 
    They just do not wear it when \travelling, nor on stealth missions like this. 
    But when the battle comes, he misses it. 
    
    Maybe Vizicar holds back his power and magic. 
    He does not want to arouse suspicion and get caught.

\section{\Shilred{} Story Arc}





\subsubsection[Ishnaruchaefir and his fake mission]{\Ishnaruchaefir{} and his fake mission}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir's fake mission}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} is clever. He knows about \hr{Teshrial's creatures}{the \noggyaleth{} in \Malcur}, or at least suspects them. So he \hr{Ishnaruchaefir attacks Teshrial's creature}{goes there to see for himself}. 

\Ishnaruchaefir initially believes \Secherdamon's plan takes place in \Malcur.
Then he falls for the \Forclin decoy when it is unveiled. 
He is impressed to learn that both were decoys. 

He has also seen through \ps{\Secherdamon} plan to resurrect \Nithdornazsh{} in \Malcur. 
He has more Sentinel contacts than most people realize, so he has spies telling him of \ps{\Secherdamon} plans. 
And he is an expert astrologer and \matrix-theorist, so he has picked up subtle clues concerning \Nithdornazsh{} and \Malcur. 

He knows that the \noggyaleth{} may put a stop to the plan. 
He wants to help his brother.
He does not fully approve of \ps{\Secherdamon} plan to resurrect \Nithdornazsh, but he helps out of respect for \hr{Nexagglachel}{\Nexagglachel}, since he still feels guilt and obligation towards him and his memory. 
\Nithd{} was \ps{\Nexagglachel}{} fortress, after all, so it can stand as a monument of sorts to the fallen \dragonking.

\target{Ishnaruchaefir's creatures}
So \Ishnaruchaefir{} plans to free some of his own servitors\dash\pdaemons, \dragons{} or otherwise\dash who are imprisoned in a cave or lost temple somewhere in the eastern \PelidorContinent. 

But he can't just go off and do that. He would be discovered and foiled by \hr{Teshrial}{\Teshrial}, the Cabalist in charge of the area around the cave. 

So \Ishnaruchaefir{} develops a circuitous plan: 
\hr{Ishnaruchaefir recruits Shilred-tachi}{He recruits \Shilred-tachi} and sends them off to fulfill an ill-defined quest for him, in the general area of the cave in question. He tells them to search for a cave or something like that. 

But whatever he alludes that he wants them to do is a lie. The purpose of their entire mission is to look suspicious. \Ishnaruchaefir{} shows up to help them just often enough that the sneaky Cabalists cannot help but notice, yet rarely enough that it still looks like he is trying to lay low. 

What he is actually looking for is another cave, where his servitors are imprisoned. 

The Cabalists in the area where \Shilred-tachi are going are led by \Teshrial{} (see section \ref{Teshrial}). We follow him in several chapters, where he fears \Ishnaruchaefir{} and tries to guess his plan. 






\subsection{Rissitic invasion}
Some time after the Rungerans cross the Pelidorian border, Rissitic fleets sail north to besiege and conquer cities in \Scyrum. 
%march north from Gaznor into Beirod. They besiege and conquer Beirodi cities. 

%Or\prikker wait\prikker is it Beirod they attack? Or is it \Scyrum? \Scyrum{} might make more sense. 

For the Rissitics, controlling more land in \Velcad{} is nice, but the chief purpose of this attack is to draw the Redcor away. See, in intra-\Velcadian{} wars the Redcor traditionally take little part, acting mostly as negotiators and healers. But in case of a major attack on an Iquinian kingdom by a heathen invader, the Redcor typically offer more direct aid, participating in battles with their magic. So when the Rissitics invade, the Redcor are forced to send Vaimons from the entire region to help oppose them. 
This makes the invasion harder, but it has the nice bonus feature that it leaves \Malcur drained of Redcor, making it easier for the Sentinels to operate there. 

We follow Narkiza on his march north through \Scyrum. 

%Is Geldashad with him, or is he off on a mission of his own?

%What about \Shilred? 

Remember to describe the Rissitic army as \hr{Glorious armies}{magnificent and glorious}.







\subsection{\Shilred-tachi get lost in \Nyx}
\Shilred{}, \Dzasselid{} and \KarsaOrlong{} (see \ref{Karsa Orlong}) take part in the initial attack on a port city in southern \Scyrum. Maybe they are together with Mestos and Semphai. Anyway, during the battle they become separated from the main army and nearly get killed by \banes. %Maybe they even flee out of the mortal Realm and stumble into \Nyx. 

Maybe \Dzasselid{} deliberately takes them into \Nyx. Perhaps he has a back-story as a double agent for the Cabal, and thus knows his way around in \Nyx. Or something like that. He needs some skeletons in his closet, remember?

At any rate, they end up in \Nyx{} and get surrounded by \banes{} or other monsters. 






\subsubsection{\Ishnaruchaefir{} approaches}
Just when \Shilred-tachi are about to be killed, \Ishnaruchaefir{} appears. He appears in humanoid form. Using magic (incl. the spell \quo{\kingstongue{khestni}}) and his mighty glaive (see section \ref{Ishnaruchaefir's glaive}), he slays the monsters and saves them. The monsters should be huge, monstrous and menacing, like in the anime \emph{Devil May Cry}. 

Given that they owe him their lives, he claims them as his own. Perhaps one of the \Gisshorns{} knows who he is and convinces the others to be respectful. Somehow or other, \Ishnaruchaefir{} beats it into their heads that he is a high-ranking ally of Rissit and that they should obey him. 

Maybe \Ishnaruchaefir{} first approaches \Narkiza{}, gives a little help and asks to borrow some of his men. 






\subsubsection{\ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} mission}
\target{Ishnaruchaefir recruits Shilred-tachi}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} sends them on a private, secret mission. He wants them to find a cave somewhere in western \Velcad{}, where they must do fulfill some as-of-yet unspecified task for him. 

\Ishnaruchaefir{} tells them that he cannot go off searching for the cave himself, as he would be detected and attract Cabal attention (and Sentinel attention, for that matter). But he teaches them an invocation that will summon him, to use when they reach the cave or are in dire need of his help. 

\hr{Ishnaruchaefir's fake mission}{The above is actually a lie.}







\subsection{\Shilred-tachi go into the \Wylde}
On their mission for \Ishnaruchaefir, \Shilred-tachi must go into the \Wylde{}. \Ishnaruchaefir{} throws them into some place which has a tenuous link to \Nyx. Perhaps a cave system that was once inhabited, or a ruined castle. It must be something sort of urban area, since \Nyx{} is city-like. 

From there, they go out into the \Wylde{}. They fight their way through monster-infested jungles. 

Maybe they encounter a native tribe. Maybe they help them, like how Karsa Orlong helps the Anibar in \emph{The Bonehunters}. Maybe they just coerce them into accepting them. Maybe they hire native guides, who later die. 

They are chased through the \Wylde{} by savage monsters, maybe zombies or lycanthropes. Monstrous almost-humanoids, at any rate. Occasionally they are harassed by the Cabal. 







\subsection{\Shilred-tachi find a ruined city}
\Shilred-tachi find a ruined city out in the wild, with broken walls, toppled towers, defaced monuments and statues and the like. It is decrepit, dead, moss-grown and spooky. 

Compare to the cemetery in the movie \cite{Movie:HouseoftheDead}. 

Remember to have some references: 
\ta{%
  There are many places of power in the world, places of convergence. Especially out in the \Wylde{}. After all, the \Wylde{} is far vaster than the settled world.}

Remember to have them fight monsters. Have a scene where \Dzasselid{} kicks the butts of loads of monsters. 







\subsection{\Shilred-tachi find a laboratory}
\Shilred-tachi fight past monsters and end up in the laboratory of some necromancer or witch-doctor. It is filled with mutilated corpses and deformed creatures\dash living, dead or undead. Like in the movie \cite{Movie:HouseoftheDead}. 







\subsection{\Shilred-tachi crawl around underground}
\Shilred-tachi find themselves underground in a system of dark, creepy, monster-infested caves. Like in the movie \cite{Movie:HouseoftheDead}. 








\subsection{\Shilred{}-tachi see great monsters in the distance}
%Remember \Shilred{} and her party. They need to do something intelligent. 
\Shilred-tachi, \travelling in the \Wylde{}, see some colossal creatures far off in the distance. They need to be at some special place or in special circumstances, being able to see into the Beyond, in order to be able to see them. 

Maybe they see the creatures on a background of \Nyx{} or \Machai{}, or maybe just the great mountains and forests of the Beast Realm (these are larger than the ones that can be seen from within the Shroud). 

Perhaps the creatures are \dragons{} and \banes{} fighting. 

Perhaps, in the end, they see \Ishnaruchaefir{} vs \Teshrial-tachi this way. 

Remember to drop hints along the way about how powerful and terrible \Ishnaruchaefir{} is. Perhaps when they see these monsters, they reflect about \Ishnaruchaefir{} and his awesome power. 







\subsection{\Narkiza{} on the move}
%Early on, we follow \Filshed{} and her party as they invade Fendor. 

We follow \Narkiza{}, first in the port city in \Scyrum, and later as his army pushes north into \Velcad{}. His invasion is one of several \quo{prongs} in the Sentinel scheme.

In \TwilightAngelRememberEmph, only little time is devoted to \Narkiza{} and the other Rissitics. They will be given much more screen time in \emph{\CarzainWithRedcorBook}. 
%in the scheme to awaken the \Haskelek, 

%\Filshed{}, maybe together with the two \Gisshorn, are sent as a second \quo{prong} on covert missions to revive parts of the \Haskelek. 

%A third \quo{prong} are the Rissitics that are with Morgan Runger. 

%There might be a fourth \quo{prong}, consisting of some non-Rissitic Sentinels. They might include \Cryocas{} and her lover, Nisgzarchiev. Or maybe Vlad Racul. 










\subsection{\Shilred-tachi reach the cave}
\target{Shilred-tachi reach the cave}
\Shilred-tachi finally reach their destination. 





\subsubsection{They see fantastic and terrible things}
They near the cave and travel through fantastic, alien Realms (perhaps parts of \hr{Machai}{\Machai}). Compare to \authorbook{Clark Ashton Smith}{The Door to Saturn}. 

They even see glimpses of the \xss. 
\Shilred{}, \hr{Shilred is a nerd}{being something of a nerd}, is amazed by what she sees. And horrified.

\lyricslimbonicart{When Mind and Flesh Depart}{
  I'm captured by the sound of the tempest winds, \\
  and my demonvoice that dwells within.\\
  The ground I walk is sour.\\
  A spectrum shines so genuine.\\
  While the earthquake starts to devour,\\
  I behold the shrine in the ruin.
}

She sees horrors and is disillusioned. 

\lyricslimbonicart{When Mind and Flesh Depart}{
  The human way of life, \\
  an inferior state of mind.
  The third stone from the Sun\\
  had become a stillborn illusion.
  
  I'm under siege of anger and fury.\\
  There is no values, no faith or glory.\\
  Antagonising mortal flesh.\\
  Life on Earth I do oppress\\
  with infernal bleedings of bitterness.
}






\subsubsection{\Teshrial{} moves out}
\Teshrial{} fails in his attempts to guess \ps{\Ishnaruchaefir} thoughts. 
When \Shilred-tachi ostensibly reach their destination\dash the main entrance to the cave\dash they are attacked by \ps{\Teshrial} monsters and must call on \Ishnaruchaefir. 
He appears in humanoid form to fight the monsters. 
\Teshrial{} is now convinced that \Ishnaruchaefir{} means business, so he rushes to his location in person, leading a group of mighty \banes{} and monsters. 





\subsubsection{Epic description of \Ishnaruchaefir{} as a \dragon}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} assumes his true, \draconian{} form. Insert an epic description of the mighty \dragon{} here, a la \bandsong{Bal-Sagoth}{Black Dragons Soar Above the Mountain of Shadows}. 

This is the first time we are shown a \dragon. 
Describe the mortals' awe at the sight. 
\Dzasselid{} might have seen one before, but \Shilred{} sure hasn't. 
She has heard \hs{myths} of \dragons{}, but reality surpasses the myths. 





\subsubsection{\Dzasselid-tachi are sent to the real cave}
\Ishnaruchaefir{} draws out all the Cabal monsters in the area. 

In the meantime, \Criseis{} sees to it that \Dzasselid-tachi are sent to the \emph{real} cave he is after\dash which is now mostly unguarded. 

They encounter some creatures that try to block their way. 
\Criseis{} zaps them.

}

They find the creatures they are looking for and set them free. Thus \Ishnaruchaefir{} has tricked \Teshrial{}, and his circuitous plan has succeeded. The freed monsters now rush to \Malcur to assist in the summoning of \Nithdornazsh. 

See \hr{Ishnaruchaefir kills Teshrial}{here} for the end of the fight.






\subsubsection{\Shilred{} is left behind near the cave}
\Shilred{} accidentally gets separated from the rest and stays behind near the cave. 
She gets to see the fight between \Ishnaruchaefir{} and \Teshrial{} in all its gory glory. 















\section{Sir James story arc}
Sir James is a \human{} Iquinian knight living somewhere in \Velcad{}. 
It might be in the east, if I want him connected to the king-thing and Vlad Racul, or it might be in the west (Ontephar or \Scyrum) if I want him connected to Telcastora Ilcas. 
I think it's going to be in the east. 

There is also Sir Lawrence, another knight. 
Perhaps Sir James' companion. 

And Prince Alistair, who later becomes King Alistair. 
I think. 

And Vlad Racul, a mysterious sorcerer who is actually the \dragon{} Candrazor (a high-ranking Sentinel) in disguise. 

Sir James discovers a Rissitic plot somewhere. 
The Rissitics work on resurrecting a part of the \Haskelek{} \daemon. 
He goes to the Redcor for help. They set out to thwart the Rissitics. 
It turns into a big quest with all sorts of stuff going on. 
There's an evil Rissitic mastermind (who?) who keeps outsmarting them, but somehow the reader is assured that good will prevail. 
And then, in the end, I assfuck the reader by having the Rissitics win, and Sir James and his party of heroes are killed. 




\subsection{The beginning}
Sir James, as a knight and minor lord of sorts, is approached by the girl Lica, a commoner who's had visions, seen suspicous things. 
His advisors scoff at the girl's fanciful tales and persuade him to dismiss her, but he does so with doubts. 
Later stuff happens to him that convinces him she was right, so he seeks her out and brings her back. 

James or his companion asks Lica: 
\ta{How old are you, girl?}

\ta{I am sixteen, my lord.}

Later, James comments to his companion: 
\ta{She is pretty, though.}

The companion laughs. 
\ta{She is sixteen, James. 
  Even my warty cackling crone of a great-grandmother was pretty when she was sixteen.}

%Turns out that Lica has seen a \bane. The \banes{} are working on some big thing, so they are getting bolder and more careless. (It's for the same reason that Catrian saw a \bane{} earlier.) Or maybe she hasn't seen an actual \bane, but merely a Cabalist working magic. Or maybe some \Nyxian{} monster. 
Turns out that Lica has seen either a Sentinel mage or some \daemon. 
And it's a good thing that Sir James starts to believe her, because it turns out the Sentinels is after her. Assassins come for her and he has to protect her. They flee back to the castle or whatever, and the authorities (Redcor church?) finally believe that something is up. 

Lica is gifted in seeing into the worlds beyond. Since her childhood she has had trouble accepting the illusion that everyone else believes in. She always wanted to see through the lie, doubt what she was told. This has continued to the current day (she is now 16 or so) and lets her see many things that others can't, but it also makes her strange (she is unmarried and unbetrothed, and her parents worry) and affects her sanity. 

Alarmed by Lica's vision, the Redcor send a delegation to investigate. Lica is brought along as a guide of sorts, and Sir James goes as her protector. 









\subsection{Lica sees strange visions}
Lica sees grim and horrid visions. 
She hates this \quo{gift}. 

\lyricslimbonicart{The Supreme Sacrifice}{
  Thought are tyrants that always return\\
  to rape and torment the heart.\\
  As darkness sweeps the face of Earth,\\
  I enter the chambers of bleeding art.
}









\subsection{Lica sees the \Morbus}
Lica sees the \hr{Morbus}{\Morbus} at work. 
She has dreams of its evil consequences. 

She sees visions of \Nyx{} and mistakes them for visions of the future. 
She is scared shitless. 

\lyricsduana{thisistheend}{This is the End}{
  I dream of a host cockroaches \\
  crawling, swarming over charred flesh \\
  up bitter blackend walls \\
  in sewer pipes now purgd \\

  then swallowd by silence \\
  echoes of a lost world \\
  of a foul smoke that lingers like stale breath \\
  of steel/glass/concrete fusion-statues \\
  rising high in a pale and infinite twilight \\
  shining beacons like bleachd bones 
  
  I see field upon field upon field \\
  of bloatd-cattle-corpses bleeding intestines \\
  staring with sightless opaque eyes \\
  of waves drowning mountains \\
  and the earth's flesh torn with angry fissures \\
  of molten-spewing-spittle \\
  and hot lashing tongues \\
  of a planet roaring/quaking/quivering \\
  with unbound vergence 
  
  shivers erupt through space and time \\
  and images flashing faster faster\prikker \\
  until finally all is annihilated 
  
  like a vacuum space sucks the debris \\
  into a black empty hole \\
  and I fall down into the void \\
  this is the end
}









\subsection{Lica suffers}
Lica feels like she is losing her innocence and being corrupted from the inside by the terrible truths she sees.

\lyricslimbonicart{Beneath the Burial Surface}{
  The sky is darkening, soon the night befall.\\
  Righteously angels are weeping for my soul.\\
  All childhood dreams are soon to be lost,\\

  I am the fallen from grace.
  
  My face is a river.\\
  See my eyes as they drown in black.
  My sacred doom and nemesis\\
  beneath the burial surface\\
  To the final act of the immortal sin\\
  I am lead by funeral winds.
}









\subsection{Lica can curse people}
Lica discovers at a young age that she can curse people. 
When people are mean to her or refuse to believe her, she can stare at them and hate them and wish them ill\dash and sometimes it happens.
This is a manifestation of her (albeit weak) \vertex{} powers.
